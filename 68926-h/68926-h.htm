<h2 class="nobreak" id="NEIGHBOR_EDITH">NEIGHBOR EDITH.</h2>

</div>

<p>The north-west wind, driving feathery flakes of snow
before it, heaps up gray masses of cloud over the sunny
afternoon, and then, as if bent on subduing what cheeriness
remains among the shadows it has brought, howls
dismally down the chimneys, moans at the casements
dismally. The Lieutenant throws himself down on the
lounge, and draws a long sigh. Kate slips quietly out
of the room, catches up her shawl and hat from the
rack in the hall, and her brother, hearing her go down
the steps into the street, wonders where she is bound
for, and why she didn’t say something about it, and
then falls back into his gloomy reverie.</p>

<p>“It may be ‘sweet for one’s country to die’; but to
live on, a shattered, helpless wreck”—and, at the
thought, he gripes the curving frame of the lounge with
his one hand, and his firm-set lips quiver; when, suddenly,
without the faintest footfall to indicate the approach
of any one, two little arms creep about his
neck, and between silvery peals of laughter a shower
of kisses falls over forehead and sightless eyes, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
either cheek, on nose, mouth and chin. “There!” cries
a childish, laughing voice, “I surpized you, didn’t I?
Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” echoes the Lieutenant, coming directly
from a horizontal to a sitting posture, his arm around
the wee mite, “so you did ‘surpize’ me, midget. And
where did you come from? Did you drop out of the
sky?”</p>

<p>“Out of the sky!” repeats the little maiden, with a
great deal of scorn and emphasis. “Why, I comed right
from our house! Katy comed after me, and we went
round to the back door, so you wouldn’t hear, and then
Katy took off my shoes, and I comed up on tiptoe in
my stocking-feet. Ha, ha! I surpized you, didn’t I?
I’m go’n to ’gin!” and away she rushes across the room
and back against him, pell-mell, arms about his neck,
and kisses raining all over his face. “There! how do
you like it?” and the room rings with her musical
laughter—in which the Lieutenant once more joins,
with—</p>

<p>“My dear young lady, I must confess that I haven’t
the least objection to the proceeding.”</p>

<p>“Young—<em>la</em>-day!” is the slow and scornful rejoinder;
“young <em>la</em>-dy! Why, I’m a little girl!”</p>

<p>“Why, so she is, just a mere baby.”</p>

<p>“A <em>ba</em>-by! (the italics are to mark the emphasis) I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
four-years-old big! <em>I</em>’m no <em>ba</em>-by! Willie’s the baby.
He’s got a new tooth! That makes three—six—five!
He’s got five teeth!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say! And what is this Edith has in her
hands—a doll?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s my dolly.”</p>

<p>“What curly hair she has. And this ruffled affair—is
it an apron?”</p>

<p>“An <em>a</em>-pron! It’s an over-skirt!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg pardon! an ‘over-skirt,’ is it? So she’s
a fashionable doll. What might be her name?”</p>

<p>“Guess.”</p>

<p>“Keturah?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Jerusha?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Mary Ann, Sacharissa, Sophia, Clarissa, Joan, Melissa,
Eloise, Elizabeth, Jane—”</p>

<p>“No-o-o-o-o!”</p>

<p>“Victoria, Eugenia, Augusta, Paulina, Virginia, Aurelia,
Geraldine, Mollie—”</p>

<p>“Yes! Mollie! that’s what it is; but none of your
other old—elephants. There, you’re laughing! You
knowed what it was all the time; you was only pertendin’.
You’ve seen my dolly before.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Katy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“She stayed down-stairs to pop some corn for me
and you.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go down and see her do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Very well.” And the Lieutenant, rising, manages to
shift little dot up to his shoulder. “There, now, you’re
a feather on top of a barn-door.”</p>

<p>“You’re <em>not</em> a barn-door!”</p>

<p>“What am I, then?”</p>

<p>“You’re my brave captain boy.” (That was in a
whisper.)</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you what <em>you</em> are? You’re my little
angel.” And, holding her carefully, he goes down the
stairs, feeling his way, now and then, with the remnant
of an arm in his dangling right sleeve.</p>

<p>“I’m almost through,” cries Kate, from the kitchen,
her face all aglow with the heat. And Edith, from her
lofty perch, watches the few yellow kernels that are
nearly lost sight of in the bottom of the wire corn-popper,
after a shake or two over the hot coals, suddenly—“Snap,
snap, snap!” and look! it is full to the
brim with something white and savory, which, seasoned
with salt and the least bit of butter, she deals out (with
great fairness and impartiality) to herself and her “captain
boy,” after they have gone up-stairs again. By
and by a thought strikes her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>“Katy, my doll hasn’t got any apron.”</p>

<p>“Why, so she hasn’t. We’ll have to make her one,
won’t we?” And a box of ribbons and laces and pieces
of silk is produced from somewhere, and the two sit
down on the floor near the Lieutenant’s chair, talking
all the time and planning out this wonderful apron.</p>

<p>“Now which of all these colors does Edie like best?”
asks Kate.</p>

<p>“Well, I think the red’s the nicest.”</p>

<p>So an apron (with pockets, observe!) is soon manufactured
out of a bit of a broad scarlet sash, and braided,
too, with white silk braid; and straightway on it
goes, in feverish haste (one is anxious to study the
effect, you know), over the stylish (but serene) Mademoiselle’s
black satin gown. (The effect isn’t bad.)</p>

<p>After due admiration from Edith, some other diversion
is in order, and a book of engravings is brought
for inspection. As the leaves are turned for her she
glances for an instant at one picture after another, giving
the word to proceed; but they finally come to something
over which she pores a long while—so long that
Kate is passing to the next without waiting for the
“Go on” from little Miss, when the latter immediately
takes the book into her own hands, returns to this picture,
and continues to gaze at it. “What does it
mean?” at length she asks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“Had I better tell her?” Kate, in an under-tone,
questions of her brother. “It’s Gustave Doré’s ‘The
Deluge’—people and wild beasts huddled together
upon a rock rising out of the waste of water, and the
great, lashing waves reaching up for them greedily,
like wide-mouthed monsters. Odd, isn’t it, that she
should notice it so, among so many more attractive
prints? She wouldn’t be likely to comprehend if I
were to explain, would she? Good, there goes the
tea-bell!” And Kate closes the book, glad of an excuse
to escape telling the story of the flood to this blithesome
little being, whom, she has a dim notion, it might give
bad dreams.</p>

<p>Seated at the supper-table, and elevated to the common
level by aid of three sofa-cushions, Edith for a few
moments bestows particular attentions upon a sauce-plate
of canned peaches, to the utter disregard of more
substantial food. After which she sits back in her
chair, and, inclining her head toward her hostess, whispers—</p>

<p>“Some of the cake, if you please.”</p>

<p>“But you haven’t eaten your bread and butter yet;
eat that first, and then you shall have some cake.”</p>

<p>“I want it now,” responds the small person, with
much firmness, and is directly supplied with the desired
article—a measure which might meet with protest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
if Edith’s mamma were present. No, it wouldn’t,
either, come to think of it, for Edith’s mamma knows
what are Kate’s ideas concerning sweetmeats. Has she
not, on a similar occasion, heard her express herself
after this manner?—</p>

<p>“If unfeeling people <em>will persist</em> in denying dainties
to the wee folks, they may just keep the stuff out of
sight. Set it right where the poor little things can
watch it with wistful eyes, and then pass it around to
the favored few, but for them—‘No, <em>you</em> can’t have any.
It isn’t healthy for you!’ If grown-up people can’t
deny themselves such things, they haven’t any right to
expect the children to. To require children to show
more strength of character than they have themselves!—oh,
it’s a downright shame! And then, leaving open
the places where the forbidden fruit is kept, and when
the midgets climb up the closet-shelves and take a bite,
on the sly, finding fault with them! Leading them into
temptation (and isn’t that what responsible people
even <em>pray</em> to be delivered from?) and then, when the
poor little things fall into the very trap they have set,
finding fault with them, and lecturing them, and all
that nonsense! Oh, it’s a cruel shame!”</p>

<p>The speaker, you see, is the children’s zealous advocate;
and, little people, if ever there is anything you
especially covet, or if ever you get into trouble, just go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
to her. She will plead your cause with burning cheeks,
and flashing eyes, and such withering eloquence that
the stern household judges will not fail to relent.</p>

<p>But it is after dark, and the snow is falling heavily,
and mamma will want her little Edith home. So Kate
sets forth with her small charge, well wrapped and protected
from the cold—although they have but a few
steps to go, as Edith lives in the next house.</p>

<p>When Kate returns, her brother’s voice greets her
from the parlor with—</p>

<p>“Sukie, heard of the last new poem?”</p>

<p>“No. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s an epic!—a grand affair—second only to
the Iliad!”</p>

<p>“Strange I haven’t heard of it, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, not so very; it hasn’t come out yet.”</p>

<p>“How did you hear of it? Some one been in while
I was gone?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do tell me, what is it about, and who is it by?”</p>

<p>“It’s about a child, I believe—but modesty forbids
my mentioning the name of the author.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you old rogue, I see what you’re driving at!—you’ve
been having a call from the Muse.”</p>

<p>“Rather from some poor vagabond tricked out in
her cast-off mantle, you mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>Kate goes and stands behind the high-backed arm-chair,
and toys with her brother’s jetty locks. (Are
they not her pride and consolation—those clustering
curls? Not all the flying bullets, and slashing sabres,
and ruthless cannon-balls could rob him of those—no,
nor the weary, wasting sickness that followed the privations
and exposure, and left him—blind.) “Come,
now, Wallie, stop joking, and let me have the verses,
won’t you?”</p>

<p>And so this is what “Wallie” says about</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CASTLE_MARVEL">CASTLE MARVEL.</h2>

</div>

<p>“Heigho-ho!” yawned Harry, who had dropped in
one evening, and curled himself up in his favorite nook,
the chimney-corner. “I wish books had never been
invented, or schools either, for that matter. I’ve been
digging away at one of Æsop’s fables for the last two
hours, and I can’t make any sense out of it at all. It’s
a lot of stuff about some doves and hawks that got to
fighting; but whether the doves eat up the hawks or
not, how’s a fellow going to find out? And I got stuck
in my algebra, too, and I sha’n’t have a single decent
lesson to-morrow, and then old Williams’ll give me a
lecture and a zero, and—well, a fellow gets disgusted
with that sort of thing for a steady diet. Oh, I tell you
I’ll be glad when once I’m out of school, and the pesky
business is done with! What’s the use of it, anyhow?
I wish I didn’t have to go another day.”</p>

<p>“But the time would be apt to hang pretty heavily
on your hands, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d find plenty to do to fill up the time, never
you fear! Now all these splendid days, along back,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
when I ought to have been down at the rink, skating,
and there I had to sit in that stupid old schoolroom,
moping over a desk! It makes me mad to think of it.
But I came over—I got so tired studying. I thought
maybe you’d have some story or other to tell, Lieutenant.”</p>

<p>“A story; what is there you haven’t heard, I wonder?
I’m afraid my stock of stories has about run out. Let
me see, though,—have you ever heard about Castle
Marvel?”</p>

<p>“A castle! that’s the kind I like—about castles! no,
I never heard it.”</p>

<p>“Well, this was a famous castle that stood upon a
high mountain, and that people sometimes went to see.
Among the rest, there went from a certain city a company
of youths. Now, their route lay across a sunny
plain that was like a very fairy-land; flowers covered
it with every hue of the rainbow, and over these hovered
clouds of golden-winged butterflies; and in the shady
groves zephyrs sang and birds caroled as never sang
zephyrs or caroled birds anywhere else.</p>

<p>“And, so, many of the youths tarried, saying, ‘It is
pleasant here; let us gather roses;’ or, ‘Let us chase
butterflies;’ or, ‘Let us lie down under the wide-spreading
branches, and listen to the music overhead.’
The others, hastening onward, reached, at length, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
foot of the mountain, and began to ascend. But to
climb this mountain was by no means an easy task; for,
while in some places it was very steep, in others a perpendicular
and seemingly impassable wall would confront
the weary traveler; and there were chasms, too,
which must be crossed; but over most of these bridges
had been built; and where the way was steep and slippery
steps had been hewn among the rocks; and up
the granite walls places had been cut for hands and
feet; and all this had been done by travelers who had
previously ascended—aye, with untold hardships, and
often at the risk of their lives. But now, in climbing,
so had the way been opened before them, these youths
met with no peril, only with labor and weariness, here
and there. And yet, ever, as they toiled upward, would
one and another turn back, discouraged, to rejoin the
comrades below, declaring that the sight of the castle
was not worth so much pains.</p>

<p>“Now to these pleasure-seekers in the flowery
meadows after a time returned the venturesome few
who had succeeded in gaining the summit, and they
were greeted with loud cries of astonishment—for behold,
their faces shone wondrously, flooded as if with
light, and they seemed like beings from another world.</p>

<p>“‘Tell us, what have you seen, or what have you
heard, that your countenances should be thus altered?’
demanded the curious throng.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

  <p class="caption">At last, as he emerges from the shadows of a dark defile
between high mountains.—<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_156">Page 156.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>“‘Ah, friends,’ replied the others, ‘would that we
might tell you the half of what we have seen, the half
of what we have heard. Truly marvelous is this castle
which we have visited, and beyond the power of words
to describe. We may, indeed, relate to you how, from
its windows, we beheld the fair earth, from pole to pole,
spread out before us in new and undreamed-of beauty;
how we found secret stairways which led us to the
burning heart of this same earth; how, through mysterious
passage-ways, we were guided to the silent and
strangely-peopled valleys of the sea; how, by tower and
turret, we mounted to dizzy heights, from whence we
could peer in among the stars, and catch a glimpse of
the glory lying beyond; how all the way, from lowest
foundation-stone to loftiest pinnacle, they who went up
before us had carved inscriptions, revealing in what
manner the world has fared—even from its creation;
how, passing to and fro, our questions were answered,
our doubts were quieted, and we were filled with such
delight as is only known to them who go up thither—this
much, and more we may relate, and yet but a faint
idea will you have of that mighty structure. Oh, friends,
so vast it is, so wide, so high,—so deep down extend its
massive walls, that, though one should wander a lifetime
within its gates, still many portions would be unknown
to him; so free and open to all it is, that whoever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
will may abide there, continually feasted and royally
entertained; so magnificent it is, that whether you go
up or down, whether you follow corridors that lead
on, and ever on, or loiter in spacious treasure-halls,
golden is the ceiling, crystal is the pavement, riches
and splendor meet you at every turn, and you tread
upon diamonds which are yours but for the picking up;
and what is most marvelous about the castle is this—the
more of these rare jewels that are gathered and carried
away, the more remain.’</p>

<p>“Then the idlers, seeing their companions laden with
precious gems, sparkling in the sunlight, could not
doubt the truthfulness of this report; and they said:
‘Let us go up also, to be enriched, and to see those
wonderful sights.’ But when they began to climb they
discovered that their strength had departed, and that
their eyes were dimmed so that they could not find the
path; and they now first became aware of how the
years had flown while they had been lingering among
the pleasant fields, and that in the feebleness of age
they were no longer able to mount upward. And they
sat down and wept with regret, and nevermore ceased
sighing, because of the years they had wasted below.”</p>

<p>“There’s a <i>Hæc fabula docet</i> to that story, I suspect,”
said Harry, good-naturedly, after staring awhile at the
fire. “But I’ll forgive you, as it’s the only one of that
sort I ever heard you tell.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_MAY_MORNING">A MAY MORNING.</h2>

</div>

<p>It is one of those first bright, pleasant days, so welcome
after the rains and clouds that follow the long
siege of winter. With the sunbeams so warm, and
the air so soft and balmy, who can choose to stay indoors?
The Lieutenant draws his chair out to the
porch, and is presently joined by Harry, who mounts
the railing and proceeds to relate an adventure he had
the other night.</p>

<p>“You see we were out on the lake, fishing—a lot of
us, and we’d caught about a dozen trout, when up come
a storm—a regular gale. Boat capsized; out we went
into the water. Rain pouring down in torrents, and so
dark you couldn’t see your hand before you. Tell you
we had to swim for it. But we got ashore at last, and
they took us in at a house close by, and dried our
clothes for us, and gave us some supper, and we had a
regular jolly time of it, after all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I heard about that excursion of yours from
another source, and about a boy by the name of Harry
who saved another boy from drowning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>“No! did you, though? Well, you see he didn’t
know much about swimming, and it was my doings, his
going with us, and if anything had happened to him
I’d have been to blame. But, I tell you, I thought one
time there we were both goners, sure. Hallo, Edith!”</p>

<p>“See my new hat!” she cries, climbing up the steps.
“I and mamma bought it down street this very morning.
See, it’s all trimmed with blue ribbons!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s really pooty. There comes Marie Maross
with her instruction book; she’s been taking a music
lesson. Say, Marie, come in and sit down, won’t you?
You look tired. Professor cross this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” responds Marie, readily accepting the invitation.
“He says I don’t half practice my lessons, and
it’s no such thing! I practiced a whole half an hour
yesterday, and on those wretched scales, too! they’re
enough to drive one distracted.”</p>

<p>Harry glares at the gate-post as if it were the professor
himself, and he is about to express, in strong
terms, his poor opinion of professors of music generally,
when—</p>

<p>“Che! cheree! cheree! te-hee, hee, ha, ha, ha!”
laughs Robin Redbreast among the budding branches
overhead. What is he cocking his shrewd black eye at
the two on the steps below for?—looking for all the
world as though he had seen them before now—passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
notes to each other in that “horrid old school-room,”
when “Old Williams” wasn’t watching.</p>

<p>But hush, you, Sir Robin, and hush, every one.
Marie lifts her hand to impose silence; for, see, there
is a wee gray sparrow prospecting about a moss basket
hanging in the porch, evidently in search of a good
building site.</p>

<p>But here comes the mail-carrier, who cannot stop for
such trifles. As he rapidly approaches Mrs. Sparrow
flies away.</p>

<p>Kate, who has been setting out tulip-bulbs in her
flower-beds in the back-yard, comes to look over the
letters. This one, from a small boy, she reads aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Deer Cozen Kate</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bob.</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Them’s my sentiments exactly,” says Harry. “It’s
been just so at our house now for a week. Everything’s
topsy-turvy, and you can’t find a place to rest
the sole of your foot. And cross? my! I thought Ann<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
would take my head off, this morning, when I tumbled
against her mop-pail and tipped it over.”</p>

<p>“Will you please give these to Mr. Walter?”</p>

<p>It is bashful little Bessie, on her way home from a
ramble in the distant wood, who whispers in Kate’s ear,
as she offers a bunch of spring beauties gathered there,
and blossoms plucked from a wayside apple-tree. Mr.
Walter receives them with a smile of recognition, for
who does not love the odor of apple-blossoms?</p>

<p>The blushing Bessie is straightway reassured and
gratified by the following fable improvised for the occasion:</p>

<p>But listen—will you?—to this score of lads and lasses,
Bessie’s companions (freed from school, for it is Saturday),
who, laden with wild flowers and mosses and ferns,
have meanwhile established themselves on the steps,
and are chattering like a flock of blackbirds:</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve had lots of fun, and I’m awfully tired.
Will you believe it? I ran over a snake! Dear me,
how scared I was!” (A girl, of course.)</p>

<p>“Sho! you needn’t have been afraid of such a harmless
little snake as that; I’d just as soon take it up in
my hand as not!” (A boy, of course.)</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you, then? Ha, ha! I’d like to have seen
you.”</p>

<p>“See, Marie, what a pretty toad-stool I found, all
scarlet inside; and Fred, he’s got a lot of snail-shells
in his pocket.”</p>

<p>“If I’d only had a gun along I could have popped
over two or three red squirrels.”</p>

<p>“Oh—h—h! it would be cruel to kill the dear, sweet,
cunning little creatures.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, puss; he couldn’t fire off a gun
to save his life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, the quantities of Bobolinks we saw in the meadows!
If you could only have heard them sing—”</p>

<p>Everybody stares at the apparition. He has stolen
a march upon them—that little tawny Italian, down
there in the street, gazing up at the merry group, with
a weary sort of smile, as his slender fingers toy with
the strings of his instrument, bringing forth many a
plaintive air. Soon the music ceases, and the tattered
hat is passed around. But he may not go yet; his audience
is clamoring for a song. “An Italian song,” cries
Marie. And so, to the accompaniment of his guitar, he
sings in his native tongue a little ballad which runs
something after this fashion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wandering, wandering all the world over,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hither and thither, and to and fro,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Free as the wind to linger and tarry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Free as the wind to hasten afar,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Hither and thither, and to and fro.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And off he goes with his merry song, and his weary
smile, and his pockets jingling with pennies; and is
succeeded by a fair-haired Norwegian, with a basket on
his head, crying, “Oranges, oranges!”</p>

<p>Harry rushes down, and buys him out of the stock in
hand, and before any one has time to protest, begins to
treat the assembled company. So it was for this feast
that the round, golden fruit has been, all these months,
basking and ripening and gathering fragrance and
sweetness from the rays that gladden a land of perpetual
summer.</p>

<p>“What’s this—a picnic?” asks a gentleman in uniform,
who has come to call upon the Lieutenant. The
youngsters follow with their eyes the blue coat and
bright buttons disappearing through the open doorway,
then they slowly disperse; and Ponto, the great
shaggy Newfoundlander, is left alone, dozing upon the
mat. And the wee, gray sparrow returns with a wisp
of horse-hair, and commences to build her nest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PATCHES_AND_PERSEVERANCE">PATCHES AND PERSEVERANCE.</h2>

</div>

<p>“There goes Patches!”</p>

<p>“Hallo, Patches!”</p>

<p>Sitting in the porch, in the twilight of a June afternoon,
Kate overhears those cruel taunts. “Oh-h-h!”
she exclaims in smothered indignation, the hot flush
mounting up her forehead.</p>

<p>“What is it, sister?” asks the Lieutenant.</p>

<p>“Oh, Walter, there are some boys down there in the
street, calling names at a little newsboy, and making
sport of his poor, patched clothes. And he looks so
downhearted and discouraged—poor little fellow! Oh,
it’s <em>too</em> bad! I wish you could say something to him
to comfort him. Mrs. McAllister was telling me about
them the other day. His mother is a widow and does
washings, and there are other children—he the eldest;
and he is so kind and thoughtful, and does everything
he can to help her; goes around town, out of school-hours,
running on errands and carrying newspapers. I
know what I’ll do”—but her plan for a new suit of
clothes is suddenly broken in upon by the boy approaching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and handing her the evening paper, damp,
just from the press.</p>

<p>“How many more of those have you to deliver?”
Walter inquires.</p>

<p>“Only about a dozen.”</p>

<p>“Well, when you get through, and if you are not
otherwise engaged, I’d like to have your company for a
walk. You see,” he adds, with a smile, “I haven’t any
eyes, myself, to find the way with; and it’s such a fine
evening I believe I’d like to go—yes, as far as the
Park.”</p>

<p>The boy looks up into the blind man’s face, Kate
thinks, as if he would be willing to go to the ends of
the earth with him.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ll be back in a few minutes,” he says,
hurrying away.</p>

<p>In one corner of the Park there is a shady, secluded
nook—a clump of trees all overgrown with vines, with
rustic seats underneath. As Walter and his companion
rest there after their long walk, the moonbeams shining
softly down between the leaves, all at once a sob breaks
the stillness, followed by another and another, and then
they come thick and fast. Now the Lieutenant does
not ask, “What’s the matter, little boy?” as a great
many thoughtless people would; for he remembers
very well that one doesn’t like to be asked such questions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
when one is crying. Besides, doesn’t he know
what the matter is? He can picture to himself the
wearisome life the poor child leads—ill-fed, ill-sheltered,
ill-clad, half the year pinched with hunger and
cold, half the year breathing the close, pent-up air of
some wretched tenement—in his brave struggle to help
his widowed mother, not always able to find work;
knocked about by ruffian newsboys, sneered at by
thoughtless schoolmates, little heeded or noticed by
anybody; till he looks downhearted, as Kate says, and
the very tones of his voice are grown dreary and sorrowful.
Thinking of all this, the Lieutenant cannot sit
there like a block of stone, and listen to those stifled
sobs. So, as there is nothing to be said, he leans over,
and with that one arm of his about the slight figure,
draws it close to his side.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re so good!” murmurs the tearful voice,
as the lad rests his head against the friendly shoulder.
“It’s that that makes such a baby of me. I can’t help
it. Other folks ain’t like that. Other folks don’t talk
to me pleasant about this and that as you did all the
way. Other folks—oh!” and with that the slender
form is shaken again with sobs.</p>

<p>“Ah, but those other folks who treat you so, you are
going to make them sorry for it, some day.”</p>

<p>“How?” The dreary young voice is full of wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>“How? Let me tell you a little story. Years ago
a young printer went to New York City to find work.
He hadn’t any fine clothes, and scarcely any money,
and I doubt if in all that great city there was a single
person that he knew. After much searching he found
something to do; and in the office where he was employed
the other printers delighted in annoying him,
playing jokes upon him, and daubing his light-colored
hair with ink. I wouldn’t wonder if this sort of treatment
made him feel sad and homesick, sometimes, and
wish he was back again among the mountains where
he came from. However, he paid little attention to it;
he worked all day, faithfully, and at night he read and
studied a good deal; and when he couldn’t afford to
pay for a light to study by, he would take his book out
by the street-lamp and study there—sometimes when
it was cold, too. Wasn’t he persevering? Well, he
worked, and read, and studied, and persevered, till he
got to be an editor; yes, in time he became the most
famous editor—or journalist, some would call it—the
most famous one that ever lived. Last fall he died—this
man who was once a penniless, friendless boy—and
at the news of his death there was sadness all over
the country; and, at his burial, thousands and thousands
of people crowded those same streets where he
used to read, shivering, by the lamp-light; thousands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and thousands went to get a glimpse of his dead face,
and wept over it, because he had helped them and they
loved him and were sorry he was gone.</p>

<p>“Oh, was it Horace Greeley?” the lad whispers.
(He has stopped crying now.)</p>

<p>“You have guessed.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought, sometimes,” says the boy, presently,
in a hesitating way—“I never told it to anybody
before—but I’ve thought I’d like to be great, too, some
time, to be a lawyer—and—and go to Congress—and—oh,
I never told it to anybody before, because it’s foolish,
I know, and they’d laugh at me. I can’t help
thinking about it, though. But of course there’s no
hope for <em>me</em>.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but there <em>is</em>, though! I doubt if our Vice-President
thought there was much hope of his ever going
to Congress when, in his youth, he was earning his
livelihood in a shoemaker’s shop. But, you see, he kept
pegging away; when it wasn’t at boots and shoes it was
at books, at gaining knowledge, and making the most of
the talents that were given him, working his way up, inch
by inch, till he became congressman, surely, till now he
presides over the Senate. And our President, at your
age, little dreamed that he would ever be called upon
to control a great army, to plan campaigns and sieges,
to ‘fight it out all summer on this line,’ as you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
heard about—persevering, you see—and so to put an
end to the bloody war, and be chosen once and again
to the highest office in the land—like Washington, long
ago. Yes, it’s perseverance that does it. Did you ever
hear of Cyrus Field, the man who brought the Old
World and the New nearer together by his Atlantic
cable? When he first proposed to do it, to send dispatches
through two thousand miles of water, that
seemed to every one a very absurd idea. But when his
cable was finished and ready to be laid, then people
began to be interested; indeed, they were really excited
over it, and it was quite the fashion to wear
attached to one’s watch-chain a bit of that gutta-percha
cable, set in gold. But the cable, or telegraph,
was a failure, after all; it didn’t ‘work.’ So people
disbelieved once more, and lost interest in the enterprise,
and took the bits of gutta-percha from their
watch-chains, and put them away out of sight and of
mind. And it fared with the experimenter just as it
fared with those trinkets. But years passed by, and
lo! one day, to everybody’s surprise, the President received
from Queen Victoria a polite message that had
taken but a few moments to cross the wide Atlantic. And
now, you know, Europe and America can talk with each
other almost as easily as you and I here, sitting side by
side. For what had Cyrus Field been doing all that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
time that nobody took any notice of him? He had
been making trial after trial, and failure after failure,
and losing fortune, and, very likely, friends, but never
losing hope. So he persevered—and succeeded, at last.
And who does your history say discovered America?”</p>

<p>“Christopher Columbus.”</p>

<p>“Well, this Christopher Columbus of whom all the
histories tell and everybody knows, he was only a
sailor boy, once, roving about in the Mediterranean,
with small chance of ever becoming noted. As little
chance would it seem there was when, years later, he
went from court to court, vainly asking aid to carry out
his project. People had hardly begun, yet, to credit
the notion that the world was round; and this tall, sad-eyed,
white-haired, shabbily dressed stranger, with his
maps and his charts, and his plans for sailing straight
West to India, who was going to listen to him? Kings
and queens were unwilling to see him or give him an
opportunity to explain, courtiers ridiculed him, children
in the street would point to their foreheads, as he
passed by, and call out to each other, ‘Look at the
crazy Italian!’ But often disappointed, always hoping
and persevering, he stuck to his project, and finally,
after eighteen long years of waiting and fruitless effort,
he got the help he wanted and started on his voyage,
and so found—not India, but America.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>And as the Lieutenant and his young guide walk
slowly homeward through the silent, moonlit avenues,
he speaks of Lincoln, of Herder, of Ferguson, of Beethoven,
of Sir William Herschel, and of others who
have risen from poverty and obscurity to honor and
renown; many of them “self-made,” as it is called,
toiling patiently and unaided up that steep hill where
the laurels grow.</p>

<p>Kate hears the hopeful ring in the lad’s voice as he
says “Good night” to his friend, and through the open
window she sees the hopeful expression upon his face
as he turns away, glancing down rather proudly at the
jacket that is mended with pieces of many shades, and
the boots that have been patched and patched again.
“What can you have been saying to him, Walter?” she
wonders. “Oh, if you could only have seen his face
just now! He doesn’t look like the same boy.” And
Walter musingly repeats those lines with which every
“wide-awake” American boy and girl is familiar. For
was it not Longfellow who wrote them?</p>

<p>When, just before breakfast, Kate opens the door to
look for the morning paper, what does she find lying
there on the threshold beside it? Fresh water-lilies—the
like of which are not to be found nearer than the
lake—miles away. “He has been all that way and
back, this morning! bless his little heart!” she exclaims,
in astonishment, as she carries them to her
brother, breathing a thousand sweetest “Thank-you’s,”
from among their snowy petals. And you may be sure
that those patched garments will soon be replaced by
others nice and new.</p>

</div>

<p>“I’d like to know,” exclaims Marie, “if there weren’t
any heroines as well as heroes in the time of the Revolution.
Now down there in the Park to-day, while they
were having their orations, and Mr. Higby got to talking
about the Revolution—”</p>

<p>“Come now,” breaks in Harry, “you don’t mean to
pretend you heard a word he said!”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do! I listened first-rate—along at first.
Katy, mustn’t he stop interrupting? Well, all I was
going to say was, that when he got to talking about the
Revolution it was all about the forefathers that he got
so eloquent, and never a word about the mothers! As
if <em>they</em> weren’t patriotic, too, and of some account! Don’t
you suppose they were?”</p>

<p>“Kate,” slyly observes her brother, “here’s another
fine opportunity for you to hold forth on the subject of
your great-great-grandmother.”</p>

<p>“Ah! just as though you weren’t every whit as proud
of her as I am!”</p>

<p>“Oh, my! <em>did</em> you have a great-great-grandmother?”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
cries the enthusiastic Marie. “Do tell us about
her.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, Miss Katy,” says Harry, seconding the
motion as he watches a sky-rocket shooting upward,
leaving a gleaming train as it curves through the air.
For this is the evening of the “Glorious Fourth,” and
the speakers are all out in the porch, where a good view
can be had of the display of fireworks down at the corner
of the street.</p>

<p>“Well, then, Harry, you know about the battle of
Cowpens, in South Carolina?”</p>

<p>“Yes, where the British thought they had won the
day, sure, and Morgan brought up his dragoons, and
they cut and slashed right and left, and put the Redcoats
to flight, and took a lot of prisoners.”</p>

<p>“What are dragoons?” inquires Marie.</p>

<p>“Mounted troops—cavalry. Oh, but didn’t they
pitch into ’em good with their swords! Wish <em>I’d</em>
been there.”</p>

<p>“And then you know, Harry, how Cornwallis pursued
Morgan, in hopes of recovering the prisoners;
and how General Greene had to come to Morgan’s
rescue. By the way, Walter, I don’t know exactly why,
but somehow all I hear of Sherman in the last war reminds
me of that General Greene.”</p>

<p>“And did your great-great-grandmother live around
there anywheres?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Marie. But you mustn’t think of her as a grandmother
at all, with gray hair and cap and spectacles; for
she was only a young girl then. There’s a portrait of
her painted a few years after. They have it at Uncle
Robert’s—little Rob’s father, you know. There she
sits, with her arms folded; and she wears a brocade
silk, with much lace about the low neck and flowing
sleeves; and her hair is combed straight up from the
forehead over a roll, and coiled high at the back of
the head, very much as the style is now—only I suppose
it was all her own, for switches hadn’t yet been
thought of.”</p>

<p>“And did she do something brave?”</p>

<p>“So the story goes. She was an orphan, you see,
and lived with her uncle, who was a hot-tempered old
Tory, and all his sons and daughters the same. But,
perhaps because they weren’t as good to her as they
might have been, she took it into her head to believe
some other way—sympathized with the rebels,
you know. But she took care not to let any one find
that out, which no one was likely to, for she was so
young, only sixteen—just two years older than you,
Marie—people wouldn’t be questioning her about politics.
Well, it was just at this time, when Cornwallis was
chasing up Morgan, that there came one rainy evening
to her uncle’s a small detachment of British troops,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
with some Americans belonging to Morgan’s force
whom they had captured the day previous, and asked
for lodgings for the night. Her uncle welcomed them
heartily, and gave them a room where they could lock
up their prisoners, and ordered Chloe, the black cook,
to get up a grand supper for them. Grand? I don’t
suppose it was what would be called a grand supper
nowadays. I presume it consisted largely of game
from the forest, venison, and the like—not much in the
way of dessert and nick-nacks, you know. While the
British were feasting in the dining-room, Kate—we
may as well call her Kate, for I forgot to tell you that
I was named after her—slipped into the kitchen, and
managed, unseen, to fill a basket with some of that
plentiful supper, and creep with it up a back stairway
to the store-room or garret at the top of the house.
Now the room where the prisoners were locked in was
in the second story, and had no window; but in the
ceiling there was a trap-door that opened into the garret.
Kate raised this door—or rather, it was a mere
piece of plank—and let down the basket by a rope.
And the prisoners, looking up and catching sight of her
friendly face by the light of the candle she held, were
gladdened, you may be sure. Ah, poor fellows, and
they were hungry, too; hadn’t had a mouthful for two
days. (Indeed, they had been out in search of game.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
That was the way they happened to be caught.) ‘Was
there any way under the sun for them to get out of
there?’ they asked her. Yes; she told them of a way
she had thought of, but they would have to be very still
about it, and wait till everybody in the house had gone
to sleep. Then she closed the door again, but she was
careful to take the basket with her, lest the Red-coats
might look in before retiring, and find it there and
suspect something was wrong. They did look in, too.
There were the prisoners, all secure. Then they locked
and bolted the door again, and for further security stationed
a guard outside. When Kate found out about
the guard she trembled for her plans. But toward
midnight she peeped into the hall and saw him nodding
sleepily, for he and his comrades, as well as their
officers, had been making free with her uncle’s wine.
In those days it was the custom to keep quantities of
wine even in private houses, and to use it freely at the
table.”</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus03.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">But in the ceiling there was a trap-door that opened into
the garret.—<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_38">Page 38.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>“Nothing of that sort going on nowadays!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say so, Harry, but I suppose there is;
though not so generally the practice, I am sure—at
least, not in this country. Well, Kate crept up to the
garret again, by the same way as before, and she lowered
a ladder—oh, so still!—to those six prisoners, and
one by one they climbed up softly through the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
trap-door in the ceiling—oh, it was just the least mite
of an opening, hardly large enough for a person to crawl
through; but then I suppose that one could manage to
squeeze through a pretty small space for the sake of
regaining one’s liberty—”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” says Harry, speaking, doubtless, from
experience.</p>

<p>“Now, you mustn’t interrupt again!” says Marie;
“just when they’re all climbing up, too; and I’m so
afraid that sentinel there in the hall outside will hear!
But, oh, Katy, when they’re all up in the garret how
ever is she going to get them away from there? Won’t
somebody wake up and hear while she’s getting them
all down that back stairway?”</p>

<p>“No, they didn’t go down that way. You see this
garret was used for a store-room for flour and groceries,
and the like; for the place was so far from any mill
or market, that when they sent to the nearest town they
used to purchase all those things in large quantities.
So, for convenience in storing away articles, a stairway
had been built up against the outside of the house.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and there was an outside door to the garret!
What a dear, delicious old house, with stairways and
trap-doors, and everything all fixed just right to help
those poor prisoners off!”</p>

<p>“Now, you mustn’t interrupt again!” says a mocking
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Down they went, under the dripping eaves; but
when they reached the ground and held a whispered
consultation, it came out that they hadn’t the slightest
idea in which direction to go to join their commander;
for they were all from the north, and perfectly unacquainted
with the country. ‘Could the kind young lady
give them some directions?’ ‘I will go as guide,’ she
said. So they helped themselves to the six chargers
of the six British officers sleeping snugly under her
uncle’s roof, and she mounted her little sorrel pony,
and away they went, through the rain and the darkness—slowly
at first, lest the trampling of the horses’ feet
should be heard, which likely would have been the case
but for the ground being softened by the rain; after
that they dashed along swiftly over hills and through
forests, for it was a wild, uncultivated region through
which their route lay. After riding a few miles they
reached a rapid stream, so swollen by the freshets
which prevailed just then—it was in January—so deep
and rapid that it was almost impossible for the soldiers,
even on their stout war-horses, to ford it, for there was
no bridge. Kate and her little pony would surely have
been swept away. So, as she could go no farther, she
told them as clearly as she could how they were to turn
to the right at such a cross-road, and to the left at another,
and to the right again when they came to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
old church; and if they kept straight ahead when
they came to a certain tall pine tree, standing all alone
by itself, they would reach the place where they expected
to find Morgan. (As he was on the move all the
time they couldn’t be so sure about that.) So, with a
‘God bless you!’ from the leader, which all his companions
echoed, they plunged into the roaring torrent,
and she turned back through the forest—where there
were fierce bears and panthers, mind you; but fortunately
the rain kept them in their dens that night.</p>

<p>“When she reached home, all was as dark and silent
as when she left; and when she peeped out again from
her room, there was the guard nodding as before; but
not really asleep. He hadn’t heard a sound. Poor
fellow, the British Colonel and the rest were going to
have him shot for sleeping at his post, when, next morning,
they found the prisoners had gone and the horses
too. How furiously angry they were! But, oh, the
uncle! his eyes flashed lightnings, and his voice was
like the thunder. Kate was wakened by his raging and
storming, with all the black people up before him to be
cross-questioned, and they declaring that ‘O massa,
dey wouldn’ a-helped dem rebel trash away fur nuffin
in de hull worl’!’ If they had, their lives wouldn’t
have been worth much. Kate knew that, or she might
have asked some of them to assist her. She meant to
bear all the blame herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“Wasn’t she a trump, though!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Harry; but she trembled like a leaf all the
time, dressing herself in a hurry, and rushing out to
confess before them all, and plead for the sentinel’s
life. ‘Oh, he wasn’t a bit to blame! he didn’t go to
sleep at all, for she looked to see! We were so still
about it that, oh, he couldn’t hear! and oh, don’t kill
him, don’t!’ And then she almost fainted away. But
the angry old uncle was angrier than ever. He ordered
her to her room, and never to show her face again. But
just at this point, when all is clamor and confusion, and
the poor, pale, frightened girl is being dragged off in
disgrace to her chamber, the house is suddenly surrounded
by the combined forces of Greene and Morgan
(for they met yesterday, and have been nearer by
all the time than was supposed), and led by the American
Captain whom she released last night, in walks
General Greene himself, to thank her for her brave
deed; and when she is led to the window, all those soldiers—ragged,
weak with hunger, as they are, footsore
and weary with continual marching—at the sight of
her, just toss up their hats (those of them who have
any) and cheer, and cheer, and cheer. And the British
Colonel and his men are prisoners themselves in about
two seconds—”</p>

<p>“Oh, jolly!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“And the mad old Tory uncle’s wine-casks have to be
tapped again, while the rebel army there before his eyes
drinks to his niece’s health.”</p>

<p>“Jolly, jollier, jolliest!”</p>

<p>“You might suppose there wasn’t enough to go
around; but you must remember that it was not such a
very big army. How large should you say, Walter?”</p>

<p>“Probably not a larger number than would be included
in two what in our last war were considered good-sized
regiments. Hardly that, for I believe Greene left
quite a force behind at his post on the Pedee river,
when he pushed across country to join Morgan; and
his whole command united couldn’t have amounted to
more than two thousand.”</p>

<p>“Just think of it! And that wee little army, half-starved
and poorly clothed, held in check the thousands
of Cornwallis! No wonder the orators grow eloquent
over our forefathers, is it, Marie?”</p>

<p>“But about Kate? Did that horrid old Tory of an
uncle shut her up in her room after that?”</p>

<p>“Take care, Miss Marie, that ‘horrid old Tory of an
uncle’ was a distant relative of ours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean to say anything against your relations,
Mr. Walter; but then everybody knows you
aren’t a bit like him, if you <em>are</em> a tease!”</p>

<p>“No,” Kate goes on, “they didn’t shut her up in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
room, but she was treated very coolly all around the
board, and as for her uncle, I believe he never spoke to
her again. What made him particularly indignant was,
that the British prisoners would insist that he was at
the bottom of it all, and had set the trap for them himself.
They had reason to be suspicious, for in that section
one never could be certain who were Tories and who
were not, so many of the people wavered in their opinions,
favoring the royal cause one day and the rebels
the next. Well, to wind up my story, Kate was so unhappy
there, that she went to live with an aunt in
Charleston till some two or three years after, when the
war was all over, and she married—”</p>

<p>“Oh, wait, let me guess who!—the American Captain,
now, didn’t she? How romantic! Then he was your
great-great-grandfather!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they came North, and lived and died right
where Uncle Robert lives now—in the same house,
only it has been altered several times since.”</p>

<p>The mention of “Uncle Robert” reminds Harry to
ask if Kate has had any more letters lately from her
little correspondent. Whereupon she produces this
one, which she received to-day!</p>

<p>“Plucky little chap, ain’t he!” and Harry giggles

that way once, and went into the cellar where it was
cool, and walked the floor for three hours. I didn’t want
any one to find out about it, for fear of a scolding, for I
expect I was old enough to know better.”</p>

<p>But Marie, who has been quietly meditating meanwhile,
suddenly breaks forth with, “I wish <em>I</em> had lived

had a chance to do something brave.”</p>

<p>“You!” laughs Harry. “I’ll warrant it would scare
you half to death to hear a mouse nibble in the wall at

<p>“Well, anyhow, I’m going over home to find out if <em>I</em>

</div>

<p>“Do you think there are any places in heaven like
this?”</p>

<p>It is little Bessie who whispers the question, as she
lies in the grass at Kate’s feet, looking up at the
glimpses of sky among the branches—glimpses as blue
as her eyes.</p>

<p>Kate looks up, too. Feathery-fine are those branches,
swaying lazily in the sunlight; lower down they grow
darker and heavy with green, till, here where she sits
beneath, everything is in shadow. She glances around.
Long, leafy avenues lead down the glens into blackness,
and up the slopes into blackness, and away, away into
blackness—the blackness of massed foliage that shuts
out the world beyond. Can the grand old cathedrals
they tell of compare with this—nature’s temple? Here
are the lofty columns—not hewn by hands, indeed; here
are the airy arches, rich with leaf-work tracery—not
carved by hands, ’tis true. This velvety turf—can any
mosaic pavement surpass it in beauty? Hardly can
windows of stained glass let in a light more mellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
than this which enters from above. She listens. Here
and there a tiny rill tinkles along the ledges; thousands
of little birds are flitting to and fro, caroling and calling
one another; and, like the sound, when heard far
off, of billows surging on the beach, she hears the
never-ceasing sough of the wind among the trees. Ah,
this wind, how cool it is, how fragrant! stooping to
finger her hair. And there is the sultry, breathless
August down in the city below.</p>

<p>Are there any places like this in heaven? “Yes,”
she answers at last, “I like to think so. Indeed,” she
adds, “it seems to me sometimes as though this world
might almost be heaven itself, if it weren’t for some of
the people in it.”</p>

<p>Just now, as if to give force to the remark, one of
those jarring voices that make discord in the music of
life, is overheard, saying:</p>

<p>“Look at Bessie Barton, off there with Kate. I <em>do</em>
wish that child would learn to hold her head up! If
<em>I</em> had the management of her I’d cure her of her bashfulness
in short order!”</p>

<p>Kate glances down. Has Bessie heard? No; her
thoughts are ever so far away.</p>

<p>“Oh, Bessie,” says the other, quickly, lest there is
more to come, “I see some cardinal-flowers down there
by the brook. Won’t you go bring me some, please?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>And as the child flies away on the errand, Kate joins
the companions from whom they have strayed, and confronts
the owner of the voice with—</p>

<p>“Now you shall not say anything against Bessie.
She’s a little angel.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t have dared to say a word, Kate, if
I had thought you were within earshot. She’s a particular
pet of yours, I believe. But how you can find anything
interesting in her, I can’t see. She’s plain, and
so shy and lackadaisical! I don’t see how she’s ever
going to get through the world without a little more
<em>vim</em>.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you’ll see. But as to her being plain, now
I don’t think so. What rosy cheeks she has! and
her eyes—why, they’re lovely. And she’s not what I
should call lackadaisical, in the least. Why, she’s
the busiest little body alive! always doing something
for somebody. And then she has talent—a wonderful
eye for figure. I think she’s going to make an artist.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Kate!” laughs Aunt Sophia, “what remarkable
people all your friends are, the younger ones especially.
There’s that scapegrace of a boy, my nephew Harry;
what do you think of <em>him</em>? No doubt you’ll say he’s
the pink of propriety. Harry, Harry! come down out
of that tree, this minute, and stop tearing about so, or
you’ll be all in rags by night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“What do I think of him? I think he’s just magnificent!”</p>

<p>“As black as the ace of spades.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s tanned up beautifully this summer, and
so full of health and spirits, with a heart as big as all
out-of-doors.”</p>

<p>“If he would only take to books more.”</p>

<p>“Oh, books are well enough (I wouldn’t, for the
world, speak slightingly of them); but books are not
everything. Of what good is all the learning if one
hasn’t the life—the strength to put it to use? Ah,
those sinewy fists! they remind me of the old Greeks.
Bless him!—the young Hercules!—when the work comes
for him to do he is going to be strong and able to do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he has a mission to fulfill, then! What may it
be, I wonder? Lassoing wild horses on the pampas?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s going to do something splendid, by and
by, that will make you all proud of him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you <em>are</em> encouraging. And there’s that little
popinjay, Marie Maross, with her saucy eyes (by the
way, I never could make out which they are, gray or
black), and her <em>stringlets</em>—I can’t conscientiously call
them ringlets (I suppose they would have been <em>wavelets</em>
if she had only known over night she was coming)—and
her white dress as limp as if it hadn’t come
fresh from the laundry this very morning. Do look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
at the grass-stains and mud on it, and half the ruffles
on one side torn off! (I don’t see how her mother
has any kind of patience with her; but then she’s an
easy old shoe.) And her sash awry, and her ribbons
flying, and her bracelets rattling, and those half-dozen
strings of beads around her neck—”</p>

<p>“Oh, not half-a-dozen!”</p>

<p>“At any rate, enough to be always jingling wherever
she goes, like the old woman in the nursery rhyme:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘With a ring on her finger and a bell on her toe.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Well, how are you going to dispose of <em>her</em>? Is she to
be a second—a sort of feminine Rubenstein, or a Pauline
Lucca—or are you going to send her as missionary
to the Feejee Islands?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure the cannibals would not have the heart to
eat her up,” Kate answers, laughingly. “The gay little
thing! I like to watch her, over there in the garden,
fluttering about among the flowers, prattling to her
grandfather, keeping him company. I always think of
the butterflies—harmless, pretty little creatures, meant,
it would seem, only to rollick in the sunbeams and enjoy
themselves, and brighten the landscape.”</p>

<p>“But her everlasting chatter! If, instead of living
opposite, you were right next door to them, as we are,
I’m sure <em>you</em> would tire of it sometimes,—especially in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
summer, when the doors and windows are all open. Oh,
I assure you, her tongue is going from morning till
night. It fairly drives me wild, sometimes.”</p>

<p>“But with all her prattle one hardly ever hears her
say anything really ill-natured.”</p>

<p>“And it’s just as uncommon to hear her say anything
with any sense to it!”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>somebody</em> must do the chattering. If none of
us ever spoke but to say something sensible, what a
fearfully hushed, melancholy sort of world this would
be. That little brook purling among the stones, there
seems to be no meaning in what it says, yet Mother
Nature doesn’t bid it keep quiet; and if all these little
birds should stop singing, though we can detect but
little sense in their merry songs, how we should miss
the music!—There!” Kate pauses, alarmed at her
own boldness, for it is like treading on matches to
argue with Aunt Sophia! “I didn’t mean to speechify;
I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well, you and I never will agree. And here
comes your angelic protégée.” Namely, Bessie, just now
approaching with Monsieur Maross, who has been
helping her gather the cardinal-flowers.</p>

<p>Did you over see any of those, lads and lasses?
There is no color richer or more beautiful than the
deep, glowing scarlet of their corollas. It is this which
gives them the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Figure to yourselves,” says M. Maross, who is a
naturalist and a foreigner, as you perceive, “figure to
yourselves some missionary priest of the early days, as
he journeys through the wilderness from one Indian
village to another. Passing some moist and shady
nook he first spies this superb blossom. He admires
it. Instantly he is reminded of <i>les chapeaux rouges</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Behold, <i>lobelia cardinalis</i> is no longer at loss for a title.”
Monsieur also goes on to state that the flower alluded
to—“Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow”—was
of this rich, vivid color. Whereupon the listeners
exclaim in surprise. They had supposed it was
white.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the general impression, but erroneous.
I have myself seen the flower growing in that country.
Had it been of white the concluding words would not
have been so peculiarly applicable: ‘Even Solomon in
all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.’ <i>Comprenez?</i>”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes; I see. If we only knew more about the East
how many of those passages would gain in force and
clearness that now one somehow cannot get at the pith
of.”</p>

<p>“You speak truly, Mees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>Presently, under some spreading beeches, the friends
and neighbors who have come to these woods, as is
their wont in sultry weather, for a few hours of recreation,
gather together for luncheon—without ceremony
of table or table-cloth, for this is “no stiff affair,” as
some one complacently remarks, but quite “all in the
familee,” as Harry says, bringing forth from its hiding-place
an unexpected treat. And now everybody understands
why so little has been seen of him to-day.
Doesn’t he know these miles of woodland by heart?
Is there any tree so tall he hasn’t climbed it, or any
stream so small he hasn’t traced it to its source? He
can show you all the crows’ nests and all the rabbit
burrows, and even hint to you mysteriously that a fox
dwells hereabout. He knows the banks where the
strawberries reddened in June, and the hill-sides where
the chestnuts will burst their burs in October, and it
is only he who could surprise the company with this
heaping basket of blackberries, so fresh and ripe and
luscious, still wet with last night’s dew.</p>

<p>“Hal, you’re a brick!” exclaims a youth of his own
age, piling his plate with the proffered fruit.</p>

<p>“Oo is weal dood, Hawy, I lite oo!” lisps the infantile
voice of Maggie McAllister, two wee, dimpled fists
making a successful dive into the basket.</p>

<p>“You ah the light of me eyes and the joy of me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
haaht!” murmurs a recent graduate from a boarding-school,
languidly inserting a dessert-spoon the while
she regards this young man—not yet far advanced in
his teens, to be sure—as benignly as if he were about
the size of Maggie, there.</p>

<p>“Let ’em help themselves,” he mutters in disgust,
setting down the basket directly, and joining Marie
where she is seated at the foot of a tree. “I can stand
half a day in a swamp and poke amongst blackberry
briers till my hands resemble the map of Germany done
in red chalk, but I can’t go that sort of thing. Let’s
wish.”</p>

<p>Master Harry has not been many seconds in divesting
of its edible surroundings that part of the fowl
which is known to all as the “wish-bone,” and which the
slender fingers of the “popinjay” always manage to
break in her favor.</p>

<p>“Say, now, what did you wish? (You have to tell,
you know.) That there would be another war or revolution
right off, so you could have a chance to show
your courage?”</p>

<p>“Now you needn’t make any more fun of my courage.
But I don’t care if you do think I’m a coward. I
belong to somebody that was brave as a lion. He was
a duke, or marquis, or something. For, you see, we
didn’t live in this country in the time of the Revolution.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“No, we lived in France, and belonged to the nobility.
I’ve been asking grandpa all about it, and he told
me such a <em>splen</em>did story.</p>

<p>“Grandpa” (she has approached the old gentleman
in a pause of the debate he is having with the Lieutenant
and some others, on the subject of French politics),
“Grandpa, won’t you tell us that story you told
me one evening, about your great-uncle, who was a
duke, or marquis, or something?”</p>

<p>Just now a sunbeam, resting on the little head, turns
the long raven “mane” to purple. Purple hair! Strange
Aunt Sophia never noticed it before, all these years!
She leans forward with a sudden look of interest. Must
Marie owe it to the dukes and marquises that she is to
grow in favor with that lady?</p>

<p>“Let us not speak of dukes and marquises, my Marie,”
her grandfather has answered, “lest our good
friends shall conclude that we are of that class of people
who, not being of perceptible merit themselves, endeavor
to make up for the deficiency by boasting of
their ancestors. Whereas,” with a twinkle of the eye,
“if we only trace back far enough, we shall find that
we all have the honor of descending from the same
illustrious tribe—the monkeys.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you wicked grandpa, to tell such fibs!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“But, no, Mademoiselle, it is even true what I say.
At least so we are informed by the celebrated Mr.
Darwin.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I don’t think much of that Mr. Darwin!”</p>

<p>“Nor I!” cries Kate. “Nor I!” “Nor I!” “Nor
I!” echo several voices. And here, in the midst of an
American forest, Darwin and his theories, after a heated
discussion, are, by vote of the majority, consigned to
oblivion.</p>

<p>But during this discussion, Harry, happening to
glance that way, discovers Kate, who has just left the
group, kneeling on the brink of a deep ravine a few
yards distant, and looking down with a very pale face.
Catching his eye, she beckons. He is beside her in an
instant. “What is it, Katy?” he questions, wonderingly.
She motions to be silent, and to look down.
On this side, for a space, the wall of the ravine is almost
perpendicular. At its base, fifty feet below, a stream
gurgles along over broken ledges of rock. Peering
over, he sees bashful Bessie Barton working her way
up this wall by aid of the shrubbery rooted in the crevices,
which latter serve for foothold; and as she climbs
she shifts from one arm to the other the little bundle
of innocence which answers to the name of Maggie, the
dimpled hands clasped about her neck. In the flash of
an eye he comprehends it all. While the grown-up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
people were disputing, the child must have slipped
away, and only Bessie noticing her absence, has come
to search. How little three-year-old ever crept down
there, cannot be explained. These tiny creatures will
worm themselves into the most astonishing places!
Harry’s coat is off directly. He is going to the rescue.
But “No,” Kate whispers, “she doesn’t see there’s any
one looking on. The least sound or motion may startle
her, and she will lose her hold, and—and there are the
rocks below!”</p>

<p>What agony, to watch some one in peril when you
may not lift a finger to save! Harry never knew such
torture as at this moment.</p>

<p>Slowly the little heroine works her way up. Will
her strength give out?</p>

<p>Oh, you Aunt Sophias, take care how you deride the
bashful people! And did you ever hear what the wag
said to the philosopher? “Why don’t you hold your
head up, as I do?” And this is what the philosopher
said to the wag: “If you will examine the heads of
wheat in yonder field you will find that only those
which are erect are empty.”</p>

<p>To those watching, the moments seem like hours.
Ah, Bessie sees them at last. Wait!—now—quick!
Four hands are reached to her, grasp her, lift her with
her burden up over the brink. And now that there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
no further need of exertion, she sinks back, weak and
helpless, in Kate’s arms.</p>

<p>“Take the child to her mother, Harry, and bring me
water—water!”</p>

<p>“Why, where have you been, darling?” asks Mrs.
McAllister, suddenly remembering her, now that Darwin
is disposed of.</p>

<p>“Me did do to find mo’ bewies.”</p>

<p>What with laving her forehead, and the fanning, and
the cool drink, Bessie soon revives. “She had got
down a good ways when I saw her first. I had to follow
so still, for fear of frightening her.” So she explains.
“It was her hat that lay here made me think
to look down.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” “What has happened?”
“Did she faint away?” ask one and another, hurrying
up; for all but the two witnesses are still ignorant of
that fearful scene.</p>

<p>“You tell them, Harry,” says Kate; “tell it to them
all! tell it to them all! We’ll have it put in the morning
papers. We’ll trumpet it from the house-tops and
the corners of the streets.” And hugging the little girl,
“Ah, my sweet, you needn’t blush so! I mean they
shall appreciate you.”</p>

<p>And noting the cries of wonder and admiration
which follow the boy’s announcements, and the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
that presses around her shy little friend, and cannot
make enough of her, Mademoiselle is overheard saying
softly to herself: “Why one can be brave, even in
these days.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_OLD_MONSIEURS_STORY">THE OLD MONSIEUR’S STORY.</h2>

</div>

<p>“Lieutenant, they want I should ask you for a story.”</p>

<p>“They” are the dozen or more of lads and lasses who,
in the pleasant summer twilights, have frequently been
seen, as now, gathered before the house where the blind
soldier lives. The sparrows soon learn to know that
door or window where they are welcome, and where
crumbs are scattered for them. They flock about it,
fearless, chirping cheerily, and make themselves at home
there. Thus these stone steps leading up to the porch
have become a favorite resort of the youngsters of the
neighborhood; for here they may meet unmolested,
and chatter and laugh to their hearts’ content; here
crumbs, in the shape of stories, are now and then
thrown out for bait; and partly they may be drawn
hither by the presence of the amused listener to their
random talk; tacitly understanding that to him, who is
denied the sight of their bright young faces, the sound
of their clear young voices is doubly sweet. But he is
not the only one who is entertained. Sometimes one
of his older friends will join the merry group—often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the venerable Frenchman who resides across the street.
It so happens that he approaches just now, as Harry is
making that time-worn request—“a story”; and the
other says, “I think that is Monsieur, coming? Perhaps
<em>he</em> will tell us one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, now, grandpapa,” coaxes Marie, “tell us about
Gabrielle.”</p>

<p>“<i>Bien</i>,” and he accepts the proffered arm-chair; “I
will tell, then, the story of Gabrielle.</p>

<p>“Without doubt, my dear children, some of you
have heard of that event in the history of France
which is termed the Revolution? I do not speak of
those more recent troubles which have distracted my
native land, but of that memorable Revolution which
blackened the closing years of the last century—a
period at which you gaze as upon a sky filled with the
darkness of clouds, and the threatening thunder, and
the fierce lightning-flashes.</p>

<p>“Ah, my children, you are happy to be of a nation
which has not that wild and horrible dream to remember.
And here I will say to you, I, that you are truly
fortunate to live in a land most free, where there is less
of oppression than in any other; where one can say
what he will, do what he will. If but he keep the laws
he is secure. He may be of whatever party he chooses.
Nobody is going to harm him. He may, if so ill-disposed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
say whatever <i>désagréables</i> he please of those who
believe not as he. He will not be obliged to fly and to
take refuge among strangers, as I myself, long time ago,
for that, in company with others, I preferred a king to an
emperor, and was not sufficiently secret about it. Deserving,
indeed, of gratitude are they who, defending
this beautiful country, have preserved to it peace and
freedom.</p>

<p>“Alas! if poor France had not been for so long burdened
with oppressions, this Revolution could not have
occurred. That was the reaction, the recoil. Let me
illustrate. I will remove from my pocket-book this
band elastic which confines it. I stretch it with my
two hands to its full length. With one hand I release
it. It flies back. Ugh! it makes me wince. (That is
a very homely illustration, is it not?) Now for a long
time the nations of Europe had been engaged in wars
in which France took a leading part. It requires
money to conduct wars. To procure it the people are
taxed. Also, there was no court so gay and luxurious
as that of France. To support this luxury and splendor
required money. Still again taxes. When taxes
are great the cost of living is increased. Thus while
there was feasting and revelry in palaces, in hovels
there was famine and misery. The little ones moaned
and sobbed for bread, and there was no bread to give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
them. The people were full of wrath at this state of
affairs. Force was required to keep them in subjection.
Now there came to the throne a good and merciful
king, who in peaceful times would have been much
revered. But, in this situation, great wisdom as well
as justice was needful. From his unsteady grasp
the reins of government slipped, as you have seen the
elastic slip from mine. Behold the recoil—most terrible!—which
destroyed the king, the queen, and all
who believed in the royalist cause. The people who
had so long suffered might now take revenge. They
who had yearned for liberty were filled with hope.
Their land was to be free, like that one beyond the
ocean.</p>

<p>“Alas! the despotism which had been called a monarchy
was succeeded by a despotism far worse, which
was called a republic. This was truly the Reign of
Terror. The guillotine was never idle. ‘Madame
Guillotine,’ it was entitled—that deadly machine invented
for those days, when victims were so numerous
it was necessary that they be dispatched in the swiftest
manner possible. This cruel slaughter was chiefly
confined to the metropolis, to Paris, until here a province
and there a city, disapproving of their deeds, refused
submission to the party in power—the Jacobins.
Armies were sent to subdue them. The city of Lyons<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
made the resistance most notable. Thousands of royalists,
fleeing for their lives, had taken shelter there,
and were zealous in the defense. They hoped by this
resistance to inspire other towns, and perhaps all
France, to arise and check the course of this Revolution—this
monster, ever thirsting for blood. Alas! it
was impossible. Besieged by the republican troops,
all supplies prevented, for lack of food and ammunition
the city was at length obliged to surrender, after a
brave and desperate struggle. For any who had taken
up arms against the republic there was now no safety
but in flight. Flight was nearly useless. They were
pursued, captured. The country was searched for
leagues around. Within the city, paid informers were
everywhere seeking whom they might report as guilty.
For the head of a priest or noble the price was doubled.
The prisons were filled, crowded. Madame
Guillotine could not work sufficiently fast. The Reign
of Terror had now begun in Lyons also.</p>

<p>“I must not pain you, dear children, with a recital
of the horrors of those days.</p>

<p>“Among the unfortunate royalists who had taken
shelter in Lyons was the Marquis de Rochemont. In
one of the fierce conflicts during the siege he had been
seriously wounded, and at the time of the surrender
was unable to attempt an escape. Nevertheless, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
had taken the precaution to remove from his former
quarters, and had established himself in a garret of a
lofty but dilapidated tenement facing upon an unfrequented
court-yard. There concealed, in a manner
which would least betoken his rank, his sole companions
his motherless little daughter and a faithful servant,
he thought to avoid the vigilance of the spies.
Often, from his hiding-place, he would hear the explosions
of gunpowder, followed by the crash of falling
buildings.</p>

<p>“What were those buildings?</p>

<p>“The residences or the property of Lyonnese, who
had engaged in the defense. The Jacobins, in their
fury, were reducing the city to ruins.</p>

<p>“One evening, as the attendant was dressing his
wounds, the Marquis asked, ‘What is the matter, Antoine?
you are pale. Your hands tremble.’</p>

<p>“The other responded; ‘Just now, as I came up the
stairs, I saw some person listening and peering at the
key-hole. As I approached he glided away. It is
enough. I fear we are discovered.’</p>

<p>“After discussing this matter it was decided that
Antoine go out, and obtain, if possible, a uniform like
that worn by the soldiers of the republic. Disguised
in this, the Marquis would depart in the night, and
await in a forest not far from the city, there to be joined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
by the servant with the child, and to proceed thence
toward the mountains and the country of the Swiss,
where there were relatives and friends who had quitted
France upon the fall of the king.</p>

<p>“Scarcely had Antoine set forth upon that errand
when two <i>gens d’armes</i> appeared. They had come to
arrest the Marquis. To be arrested, that was the cell,
the mock trial. After these—the scaffold. Had they
come in the name of law and order he would have resigned
himself to that fate. They came in the name of
disorder and opposition to law. <i>Bien!</i> Disabled as he
was, rising, he drew his sword. They supposed to overpower
him. Sword met sword. The hunted stag brought
to bay is dangerous. One of those intruders was slain.
The other, wounded, fled. Soon he would return with
assistance; accompanied, perhaps, by the mob. No
time was to be lost.</p>

<p>“Seizing his little daughter, who had been a terrified
witness of that scene, the Marquis hastened away, along
a low passage leading to the stairs. A ray of the moon
lighted an apartment as he passed. He saw through
the open door heaps of rags. The ragman lay sleeping
in their midst. Near by were his tattered coat, his
wooden shoes, his greasy cap, his basket. The basket
was furnished with a lid. One thinks rapidly on such
occasions. The Marquis entered, arrayed himself in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
the coat, the cap, the shoes, forgetting not to leave some
gold coins in their place, as compensation. The basket
would contain the child.</p>

<p>“‘Fear not, my little Gabrielle,’ he said, as he concealed
her in it, ‘but remain quiet while I carry thee
away where those terrible men cannot find us.’</p>

<p>“With this basket upon his head, thus shadowing
his face, he descended through the building to an entrance
in the rear, which opened upon an alley. There
he hurried along. Already he could hear the shouts
and cries of people gathering in the court-yard. He
quickened his steps. Not far distant was the bridge
which spans the Rhone. He arrived there without interruption.
To proceed, to attempt to traverse the extensive
plains beyond? Already, doubtless, pursuers
were upon his track. In no disguise was there security.
At the same time the earth seemed to be whirling
about. There was a ringing in his ears. He saw
some boats upon the bank below. He approached and
shoved one of them into the water. He lifted Gabrielle
from her concealment and placed her in it. He then
rowed out into the midst of the river. There, no need
of oars. The current is swift, strong. It rushed with
them away from danger and the doomed city. He laid
himself down in the bottom of the boat. In the moonbeams
Gabrielle saw his face very white. She saw his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
lips move. His hands reached out to her. She crept
to him. Then all was silent. ‘He sleeps,’ she said.
Soon she slept also.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp53" id="illus04" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus04.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“Remain quiet while I carry thee away where those terrible
men can not find us.”—<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_68">Page 68.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>“When Gabrielle opened again her eyes the sun was
shining; the boat was no longer afloat, but lodged on
the sands under willow trees. A rough voice was saying,
‘What’s this?’ and Gabrielle saw a man in rough
clothes bending over.</p>

<p>“‘It is my father,’ she said. ‘He is very weary.
That is why he sleeps so long. You must not wake
him.’</p>

<p>“‘That would be difficult,’ muttered the voice.</p>

<p>“True. The Marquis had received a sword-thrust
in that encounter with the <i>gens d’armes</i>, and had expired
from loss of blood.</p>

<p>“The rough man went away to a cluster of cottages
near by. Soon he returned with several people, men
and women. One of the latter offered sweet-cakes to
Gabrielle. She had a pleasant face, too, but there were
tears in her eyes. Gabrielle was hungry. When the
sweet-cakes were gone she asked for more.</p>

<p>“‘If you will come with me to my house,’ said the
good woman, ‘I will give you all you wish.’</p>

<p>“Gabrielle went home with her. After the dame
had amused her some hours she desired to return to
the boat. Her father was not there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>“‘Where is he?’ she demanded, weeping.</p>

<p>“The good dame pointed to a mound with the soil
fresh upon it. ‘When people sleep a very long time,’
she said, ‘they always are laid to rest in such places.
They sleep better there. No one can disturb them. Once
I had a little girl who is sleeping thus. I miss her.
Will <em>you</em> be my little girl?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ answered Gabrielle, ‘until she wakens and
my father wakens. Then I will have mine, I, and you
will have your own.’</p>

<p>“After, she learned better to understand those matters.
Also, as she grew older, she learned to be very
useful. She could drive the cow from the pasture and
assist in tending the garden. She could make the soup,
the bread. She learned to sew, to knit, and to spin.
Sometimes she heard them talk of a wonderful person
upon the throne, who was conquering all the world.
They called him Napoleon. The Revolution was finished.
France was no longer a republic.</p>

<p>“One day, as Gabrielle stood at her spinning-wheel
before the door, two travelers rode by. One of them
gazed at her attentively. He addressed a few words to
the other. They halted and accosted a villager who
was passing.</p>

<p>“‘Who is that young girl?’ they asked.</p>

<p>“The villager—it was he with the rough voice—related<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
how the waves had brought her to them, how that
he had found her—a sleeping child in the arms of the
dead. ‘The man was clad in rags,’ said he, ‘but he was
provided with a purse containing much gold, and with
a sword.’</p>

<p>“‘It is true,’ said the stranger who had first observed
Gabrielle, and who seemed to be the attendant. ‘There
was a collector of rags who lodged near us, and who in
the crowd, after the escape of my master, complained
of the loss of his coat.’</p>

<p>“They requested to see the sword. When it was
shown to them, the attendant said, ‘It is the sword of
the Marquis. I recognize it by the carving of the hilt.’
Then gazing once more at Gabrielle, he exclaimed,
‘How she is like her mother!’ (She had grown very
beautiful.)</p>

<p>“He approached, and seizing her hands, covered
them with kisses and with tears. ‘Dost thou not remember
me?’ he asked, ‘me, old Antoine?’</p>

<p>“She had not forgotten entirely of that Antoine.</p>

<p>“‘And I,’ said the other, embracing her, ‘I am thy
father’s brother. It is a long time that we have searched
and made inquiry for thee.’</p>

<p>“It was my grandfather. He took her far away to
his home. But the good dame was presented with the
purse, filled with gold, which she had been keeping
for Gabrielle’s dowry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>“And the sword? My dear children, if any of you
have intention to some time visit France, I can indicate
where you will find an ancient chateau, in which is a
gallery—a place of armor—where, among shields, and
helmets, and coats of mail, and spears, and tattered
banners, and other relics of past centuries, still is to be
seen this sword. It was Gabrielle herself who pointed
it out to me, many years ago, when I was a young boy
like Master Harry, and she was a marchioness, and presided
over the same chateau. And she it was who at
the same time told me this story.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Mr. Walter, where did you find this great, nice,
beautiful dog?” asks Marie, who has been having a
romp around the room with Ponto.</p>

<p>“I didn’t find him; he came to me.”</p>

<p>“Came to you! Oh, now there’s some story about
him! And you are going to tell it to me?”</p>

<p>“No, Marie, it’s all about a battle. Girls don’t like to
hear about battles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they do, sometimes. And you know you
never will tell us anything about the war;—does he,
Katy?”</p>

<p>But Katy has quietly left the room.</p>

<p>“Well, Marie, once I woke up after a battle, and
something, I couldn’t see what, was tugging at my
coat. There was a sun in the sky the last I could remember.
Now it was night, and a very dark night. I
reached out to feel what sort of creature this was.
Then I first discovered that my right hand was gone.
But with the other I could feel the head and long
silken ears of a dog. He seemed pleased to have me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
notice him, licked my face, and gamboled about, then
commenced to tug at my clothes again. He seemed to
want something of me. I finally got up and tried to
follow him—tried, I say, because it is no easy matter
to walk about the field of battle the night after it has
taken place. One is apt to find obstacles in his way.
As I groped along, and my eyes became accustomed to
the darkness, I could just distinguish from the surrounding
shadows the figure of this strange guide of
mine. It was a monster of a dog—a black, moving
mass. I had known of one other like him. An idea
occurred to me. Perhaps this and that dog were the
same. That dog’s name was Ponto. So I called—‘Ponto?’
to try him. Back he came bounding, directly,
leaping upon me, and seemed quite delighted. I was
pretty certain this was the dog I knew. As I went
along talking to him, some one spoke from among the
shadows—‘Is that you, Walt?’ There was only one person
who had been wont to address me after that fashion.
He had recognized <em>my</em> voice. Now I recognized <em>his</em>.
And it would have been strange, surely, if we had not
known each other’s voice. We were together at college
for four years, and great friends—‘most intimate,’ that
is the expression, I believe. I sometimes went home
and spent vacation with him. (He lived in Virginia,
among the mountains.) And sometimes he came home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
with me. You would hardly remember him; yet, when
a very small carriage, containing a very small child,
used to stop at our door, he was always on hand to lift
out that little Mademoiselle and bring her in—only a
dainty bundle of embroideries, apparently, till two
bright eyes peeped forth, and pretty soon two little pink
fists that would get at his hair and pull it, and <em>that</em>
used to tickle him immensely. Yes, as I said, we were
the best of friends. Then suddenly there was a great
gulf between us; and we saw, and heard, and knew no
more of each other. It appears that, though we were
not aware of it, we had been fighting against each other
that very day. But now Ponto had brought us together
again, and we were glad enough to meet. So glad we
could forget, at last, that he belonged to the army of
the South, and I to the army of the Union. We had a
great many matters to talk over, not having seen each
other in some time. Ah, but we <em>couldn’t</em> see, as you
know. So we had to be content with saying our farewells
in the dark. For that was the way our talk
ended, Marie. He passed away, there in the night, I
supporting him as best I could. Ponto was his dying
gift. Come here, old fellow.” And the Lieutenant
hides his face against the dog’s shaggy shoulder.</p>

<p>Marie steals softly from the house and toward home.
And when, a moment after, Kate comes down the hall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
stairs and into the room, Ponto lifts to her great, gentle,
human, sympathizing eyes. Perhaps he guesses
she, too, has a share in those remembrances. For who
shall deny that he has thoughts?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="A_SECRET">A SECRET.</h2>

</div>

<p>“Why, <em>you</em>, Harry? I didn’t know you had come
home!” Kate, glancing up from the book from which
she had been reading aloud, has only at this moment
noticed the boy’s entrance.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been home yet. I wanted to consult you
first. You see I’m expelled.” (Harry, you must know,
has been away at school since early in September.)
“Thought I’d tell you on the start, so you wouldn’t
feel imposed upon. Why, you take it all as a matter
of course! You don’t look a bit surprised!’</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, we’re <em>not</em> very. And how do you
do, you blessed boy? You don’t know how we’ve
missed you!” And Kate seizes his two hands with a
heartiness that proves her faith in him is still unshaken.</p>

<p>“Miss Katy! if you’ve got a particle of respect left
for me, won’t you give me some supper? I’m hungry
as a bear. Just got in on the train. Haven’t had a
mouthful to eat since noon!”</p>

<p>“The poor child! So he <em>should</em> have some supper.
I’ll go directly and see about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“This was the way it happened,” Harry explains,
over the waffles and coffee. “You see, when I first
went there the boys were a solemncholy lot, oh, I tell
you! studious as owls, got to improve each shining
hour, and all that. Well, I thought if that sort of thing
was going to last I shouldn’t survive long. So I went
to work and got ’em stirred up after awhile, and things
got to be kind of lively. But Tabby—that’s the Principal—the
way he hangs his eye out’s a caution. Oh,
no, Miss Katy; that’s only a nickname we gave him;
he’s got such a cattish way of prowling around nights
to see if there’s any doings going on. Anything but a
sneak! Well, I thought I’d be even with ’im; so last
night I laid torpedoes all along the hall; oh, Miss
Katy, nothing but those little paper wads that never
hurt anybody in the world. Well, the last bell rung
and we put out the lights, and lay still and listened.
By’n by—pop! pop! pop! Tabby was coming to see
if everything was all right. Ha, ha! guess his moccasins
must ’ave run against every identical one. You’d
’ave thought he was having a Fourth of July celebration
out there all by himself. But wasn’t he hoppin’
mad, though! Called me into the study this morning
right after breakfast.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp53" id="illus05" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus05.jpg" alt="" />
  <p class="caption">“Ha, ha! guess his moccasins must ’ave run against every
identical one.”—<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_78">Page 78.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>“‘Did you place those torpedoes in the hall last
night?’ says he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>“‘Yes, sir,’ says I.</p>

<p>“‘What was your object?’</p>

<p>“‘Fun,’ says I.</p>

<p>“Well, he gave me a long lecture, said he didn’t like
my influence in the school, that he’d had more trouble
during the few weeks I’d been there than in any five
years before. Well, the long an’ short of it was I’d got
to leave. That was just what I wanted. So off I
come, and here I am, with a letter for father in my
pocket that gives me an awful setting out, I expect.”
(Harry’s countenance grows suddenly grave.) “I
wouldn’t care if it was only father I’d got to chalk up
to; but Aunt Sophi’!” (No use trying to describe the
tone in which that name is uttered.) “I thought,
Katy—I thought, maybe you’d be willing to go over
there, and—well, kind of talk her around, you know—why,
kind of smooth matters, that is, so she won’t
be quite so hard on a fellow. Won’t you, now? If you
will I’ll go back there to old Williams, and I’ll study
like anything! I will, now, and behave myself; oh,
you shall see! if you’ll only go this once.”</p>

<p>Kate doesn’t like to get up a reputation for being
meddlesome; but she recalls how kind and attentive
this boy has been to her brother, and it is not in
her heart to refuse. So she leaves the two chatting by
the fireside and crosses the street to spend an evening
with Aunt Sophia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know what possesses me, sometimes,” says
Harry, at length, waxing confidential as usually when
alone with the Lieutenant. “I believe it’s the Old Nick!
I was always getting into scrapes ever since I was
knee-high to a grasshopper. Now, some fellows find it
smooth sailing all along, never get into trouble. I
wonder why?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they are not so blessed with animal
spirits.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t see how it’s to be called a blessing.”</p>

<p>“The river flowing through our town is a mischievous
river, sometimes, especially in spring, when the
snow is melting, and, overfed by the streams from the
hills, it comes rushing along, sweeping away dams and
bridges, and tearing about generally, in a very unreasonable
fashion. Yet farther on, at Factoryville, where
it plunges over the rocks, it keeps the mills going all
the year round. In fact, there would be no mills there
if it were not for our brave little river ‘putting its
shoulder to the wheel.’ Besides, we must admit, it is
quite an important feature in the landscape, winding
among the woods and fields, flashing and shimmering
in the sunlight. And how often you and I have stopped
to listen to the plash and ripple of its waters as we
walked along the banks. I remember what company
that music was to me, one dark night, a good while ago,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
when I was returning from a long tramp up the valley.
Just so, since the loss of my eyesight has made for me
continual night, you scarcely would believe, Harry, how
many times I have been cheered by your merry flow of
spirits. As sister says, we have missed you. It is no
small thing to be missed by one’s friends when he is
away from them. Nor is such a good-for-nothing,
stove-up piece of humanity as myself the only one you
can find to cheer, if you will look about you. Life is
full of shadows. It is a sorrowful sort of night to
multitudes of people. Such natures as yours were
meant to make the darkness less dreary, and when you
come to the mill-wheels to turn them.”</p>

<p>“But the mill-wheels? I don’t exactly understand
about that.”</p>

<p>“Well, for instance, the weather is growing cold;
winter is not far off. We sit here by a fire and find it
very comfortable. There are a good many to-night who
haven’t any fire. We have had our supper. There are
a good many who must go without. If you will notice
in the streets to-morrow, you will see little feet shoeless,
stockingless. People who go without food, and
fire, and sufficient clothing, get sick, have fevers, diphtheria,
what not? But, unfortunately, the fevers, and
so forth, won’t stay shut up in alleys and tumble-down
tenements; they creep out, out into the broad streets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
into the fine mansions of brick and stone, and all over
the city, hunting for the cunning little Ediths, the
pretty Maries.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I never thought of that!”</p>

<p>“People who haven’t food, and fire, and warm clothing,
often attempt to steal them, or the wherewithal to
pay for them. People who steal, if they are caught at
it, go to prison. When they come out again nobody
will trust them or employ them. Since they cannot
find work, and have got to live somehow, what must
they do? Steal. So it comes about that a great many
people steal for a living. And where did all this crime
commence? Like the fevers, with the lack of food, and
fire, and clothing. As Tennyson’s ‘Northern Farmer’
says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘’Tisn’ them as ’as munny as breäks into ’ouses an’ steäls,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Them as ’as coäts to their backs and taäks their regular meäls.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Noä, but it’s them as niver knaws wheer a meäl’s to be ’ad.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That puts me in mind of the fellow that broke into
our house.”</p>

<p>“This is the first I have heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Why, you see, one night last winter I thought I
heard somebody in the dining-room. So down I went.
There ’e was at the sideboard. He’d got it open, and
was taking the silver out. Well, I pitched at ’im—you
know I’m some on the muscle—and got hold of his revolver,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
and there I had ’im. But my! he looked so
starved, and kind of forlorn, and hollow-eyed, I opened
the front door for ’im and let ’im go. Expect I ought
to ’ave handed ’im over to the police. Guess I never
told of it before. It might scare the women-folks, you
know. But wouldn’t it give Aunt Sophi the fidgets?
After that I used to sleep with one ear open. She
didn’t know she was sending away her watch-dog when
she hustled me off to school in such a hurry.”</p>

<p>The Lieutenant reflects. Here is a boy who does not
hesitate to cope with a burglar, who has been known to
risk his own life to rescue a drowning companion, and
yet is loth to enter his home from dread of an Aunt
Sophia’s tongue.</p>

<p>“Then turning the mill-wheels,” Harry resumes,
“that means helping the poor?”</p>

<p>“Partly, yes. Though, as one thinks about it, it
seems to imply much more.”</p>

<p>“But where’s a body to begin? There’s poverty
enough, I suppose; but some are so proud you can’t
get at ’em, and some, but they’ve got the cheek! dogging
you and sticking their paws out for a penny every
turn you take. I always think they’re sham.”</p>

<p>“It might be a good way to exercise one’s ingenuity
finding out. As for the pride, you’ve read in the story-books
of the needfuls that found their way mysteriously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
to empty cupboards. It sounds rather fanciful;
yet there are people who take great delight in putting
romance into real life, and a generous deed is none the
worse for being delicately done.”</p>

<p>“But that <em>would</em> be jolly, now! Jinks! I’d go at it
to-morrow if I only knew where to begin.”</p>

<p>“Sister could give you more information on that
subject than I can. You two will have to put your
heads together and talk it over. Ah, yes! and I have
in mind a little newsboy to whom you can be of service.
I really believe our rollicking Harry would be
better satisfied with himself for using some of his extra
energy and pocket-money in these ways. Come,
let him give the Tabbies, and Old Williamses, as he
calls them, a rest. There’s something better for him
to do than worrying them. As I heard said once:
‘There is so much to be done in this world! There are
so few to do it.’ You are going to be one of those few,
surely. A rich man’s son has it in his power to set a
great many wheels in motion. You see the Lieutenant
is quite a sermonizer when he gets fairly started. But
I have taken this opportunity to be earnest, for once,
and before it is too late.”</p>

<p>Before it is too late! Harry, who has been wondering,
the while, at this serious language, so uncommon
from his genial friend, wonders still more at that expression.
What does he mean? He asks, finally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“I’m half sorry I let the words escape me; but now
that I have aroused your curiosity, and since you trust
me with your secrets, well, yes, I will tell you. You
know one mustn’t expect to engage in battles and come
out whole and sound. One day a small, round piece of
lead discharged from a rifle took lodgings in my shoulder,
and has since been slowly working its way down
towards my heart. So it seems that a bullet is to be
the death of me after all.”</p>

<p>Harry stares at the Lieutenant in mute amazement.
Death! He suddenly becomes aware how strong are
the cords of love which bind him to the blind man. To
lose him, his best friend! No more confidential talks,
him no more to come to in trouble, and doubt, and
perplexity, and lay open all one’s thoughts! he who
first discovered good in the wayward nature—a little,
tender plant, so covered by the dust that others could
not see, and helped it to grow and thrive in spite of the
trampling that else would have destroyed it.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lieutenant! it isn’t true! Something can be
done!”</p>

<p>No, it appears from the reply, nothing can be done.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows? Katy doesn’t know?” the boy
asks, at length, in a husky, tremulous voice.</p>

<p>“The surgeon and Lem have known of it only. It
was on sister’s account that I wished the matter to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
kept quiet. I wanted to spare her the sadness as
long as possible. But I must tell her very soon. It
will not do for it to come upon her too suddenly. Ah,
my Katy!” and another voice is low and tremulous.</p>

<p>“Is it painful ever?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes.”</p>

<p>“And you’ve kept it to yourself all these years!
We didn’t know!”</p>

<p>From the chimney corner where he has been lounging
Harry gazes once more at the patient face, pallid
from silent, secret suffering, at the empty sleeve, at
the eyes which cannot see; then he throws himself flat
upon the carpet in a fit of weeping—he who so rarely
sheds a tear—and his surprise, and grief, and anger,
take expression in one passionate outcry against the
war which caused all this—that brothers’ war!</p>

<p>But as he lies there sobbing, listening to some calm
and soothing words, there comes to him—even to
Harry—a remembrance of a face he has somewhere
seen pictured. That, too, was a pallid face and patient.
It drooped from a cross; and the brow was encircled
by thorns; and underneath was written:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">IT IS FINISHED.</span></p>

<p>“It’s lonesome without <em>him</em>!”</p>

<p>You may have noticed those high walls which some
build about their houses and grounds, so high you can
get but a glimpse of the tree-tops above them; the
shady walks, and gushing fountains, and green grass-plats,
and bright flowers are entirely hidden from view.</p>

<p>A certain great man died, and the tidings was carried
swiftly and far, for his name was known to many
nations. All over the land there were public demonstrations
of mourning, and numberless and eloquent
were the eulogies pronounced. Thus he who, living,
had been laden with honors and distinctions, went in
pomp and honor to his burial. Yet somehow we do
not hear that any one was really very sorry because of
his death, much less that any little children wept
because of it. Had his greatness been like a high
wall, concealing whatever was sunny and winsome in
his nature? On the same hillside where that great man
was laid to rest there is a new-made grave beneath the
cedars, and not very many people know anything about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
it; but among those who do there is a void, as when
the fire goes out upon the hearth-stone, and all is cold
and desolate. “It is no small thing to be missed by
one’s friends when he is away from them.” Little did
he consider, who spoke thus, how truly those words
would soon apply to himself. And here one might
pause to ponder. Which is preferable—to be so great
and renowned that when one dies the news will be told
abroad in the world, or to be so genial and lovable that
even a little child will weep at the sight of his vacant
chair?</p>

<p>A wee bird made its nest out in the porch last
May, and lived there the summer long. But the summer
is gone, and the winter is come again, and the bird
has flown away, and the nest is empty, and the snow is
on it and on the ground, and the clouds are gray and
threatening, and again the wind wails at the casements,
moans down the chimney. Lem, coming in to replenish
the fire, sees the form shivering over it in spite of the
warmth, sees the wide, tearless eyes, with the new,
strange look in them, sees the carpet strewn with remnants
of a rare and fragrant bouquet, Harry’s gift, torn
to bits by nervous fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>“Miss Katy,” and he lays his hand gently on her
head, “try to think of something else; jess try.
Think of all the poor folks you an’ Mr. Harry’s got
on the dockit, an’ what’ll become of ’em if you don’t
pick up sperrits an’ help ’im look after ’em a little.
Come, they’s no time to be settin’ here idle!” You
would hardly guess his voice was choking, and that
tears were streaming down his black face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lem,” she answers drearily, “I’m tired; I’m
tired of living. I can’t care for anything any more.”</p>

<p>“But you <em>must</em> care, honey. What’ll become of poor
old ’Liza an’ me if Katy goes off an’ leaves us too?”</p>

<p>But she only hovers more closely over the fire, staring
at it vacantly. And the wind moans and wails down the
chimney.</p>

<p>Lem returns to the kitchen to consult with his wife,
Eliza, as to what shall be done for her in whose welfare
they have felt such a tender interest since, years
ago, she and her brother were left orphans. Not all
the heartfelt sympathy of young and old, and the
loving little attentions of the children, seem to be of
any avail. Eliza advises to go for Edith. “She used
to ’muse Master Wallie.”</p>

<p>But once in the room, her toys about her, Edith soon
ceases to play. There is a change. Somebody is gone
who used to be here. She may somewhat have forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
all that has been passing of late, scarcely can have
understood what has been told her; but whether she
thinks about it or not, or remembers, even, she feels a
want. “It’s lonesome without <em>him</em>!” Ah, that is it;
and she begins to sob, creeping close to Kate. But
what new thing is this? Katy doesn’t notice her!
Those queer, staring eyes, that do not turn and smile
upon her, they are not Katy’s eyes. That white, stony
face, that is not like Katy, either. And all the while
the wind is moaning and wailing, and the gloomy
clouds grow gloomier, making the day dreary and the
room dreary. Everything is dreary and lonesome, and
not as it used to be. She flies into the hall, crying and
calling to Lem, below.</p>

<p>“Take me home! I’m afraid! Katy isn’t Katy any
more!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come back, Edie!” calls Kate, arousing at that
pitiful little cry and holding out her hands to the child.
“Don’t go away and leave Katy all alone! She’ll be
good now. She’s sorry she scared Edie; she didn’t
mean to.”</p>

<p>“<em>Are</em> you all alone?” Edith has stopped crying
suddenly. There is a peculiar earnestness in her look
as she questions.</p>

<p>“Yes, Edie, all alone! all alone!” and the answer
ends almost in a wail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>“Then it’s there—there, behind the book—the paper
that he did write on. I must give it to you when you
was all alone, he said—my captain. He said, would I
’member? Ha, ha! I <em>did</em> ’member, didn’t I?”</p>

<p>Kate opens the book-case, and finds, as the child
said, a folded paper behind one of the encyclopædias.
It contains some lines written with pencil, so running
together, lines and words, as to be almost unreadable.
As she recognizes that handwriting and slowly
deciphers it, the tears come at last like rain. Edith,
no longer afraid, wipes them away with her little white
apron, murmuring, the while, all sorts of baby talk.</p>

<p>About two hundred years ago there lived a blind
man who was the author of what many think to be the
greatest of poems. But wherever that wonderful work
is read and admired, there, too, it is told how his
daughters, with one exception, were unkind to him and
undutiful, refusing even the task of committing to
paper those immortal verses. However, it may be he
was a trifle to blame, himself. (For we have seen, as
in that other case, how greatness does sometimes build
for itself a barrier, a high, impassable wall.) Suppose
day after day little eyes looked up wistfully, and he did
not see—gazing far off into other worlds and other ages;
little voices whispered timidly, and he did not hear—listening
to the converse of angels; little hands clung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
caressingly, but unheeded. Ah, that was asking for
bread and getting a stone. Suppose it made some
little hearts ache, some little people were “afraid,”
finally, like Edith, awhile since. So when they grew
up and he grew old and sightless, what came of it all?
<i>Paradise Lost</i>, to be marveled at as long as the English
language is known and studied, and there in shadowy
background, the mighty genius, poor and blind, with
his unloving daughters.</p>

<p>And now, girl readers, here is that writing which to
her, so sorrowful, is like a consoling message from the
Beyond.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">FOR MY SWEET SAINT CATHERINE.</p>

<p><i>There was once a blind, crippled, helpless hulk of humanity who
had a sister. And such a sister! All the women who ever wrote
books, or painted pictures, or spoke or sang to gaping crowds, weren’t
worth her little finger. At least, so he thought—this selfish fellow—and
with good reason. For he owed it to her that life was not a burden;
rather, he owed it to her that life was a pleasure. Ah, what
could she have done that she did not do for him? Like a good fairy
she hovered about him, studying and scheming for his comfort and
diversion from morning till night. Would he be read to? She
would read to him by the hour. Did some rhyme or foolish fancy
escape him? She was only too eager to preserve it. She was eyes for
him, she was his good right hand, she was everything! Ah, how
unmindful of self, how thoughtful of him always! even striving to
forget some sorrows of her own, lest her sadness might make him sad!
And now that he is gone, and she has nothing to regret—not one impatient
word or act—and to remember only unwearied, loving care,
ceaseless devotion, let her be comforted. Surely “she hath done what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
she could.” Oh, my sister, my sister, be comforted! and let us dare
hope that of those who watch over thee, unseen, he who writes this may
be one.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Daylight slowly fades from the wintry sky, the firelight
flickers up and down the wall, and, as night descends,
little Edith falls to sleep in Kate’s arms. But
are these two alone? For though there is seen no
shape among the shadows, nor is heard the sound of any
voice, what is that something that like a radiance suddenly
overspreads the bowed face? “The peace which
passeth all understanding.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="JULIE_JULIEN_AND_ONCLE_LE_CAPITAINE">JULIE, JULIEN AND ONCLE LE CAPITAINE</h2>

</div>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Who could she be—the little stranger asleep in the
cabin?</p>

<p>Nobody could tell.</p>

<p>She must have come aboard unnoticed, hours ago,
at the French port where the vessel had been lying for
repairs. Had she wandered away from her home, and
innocently lain down here to rest? In that home there
would be grief, and anxiety, and long waiting, or ever
she would return; for the ship was now many leagues
out at sea, and the child had just been discovered.</p>

<p>The sound of voices talking the matter over wakened
the little girl, and she shrank timidly from all the eyes
fixed inquiringly upon her. So the captain sent every
one away, and sat down by her, and in her own language
questioned:</p>

<p>“How came you here, little one?”</p>

<p>“Is not this, then, the ship which goes to America?
There was a man in the street who told me it should
go to America. Is it, then, a mistake?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“No, not a mistake. And you wish to go to America?”</p>

<p>“Oui, monsieur. I go to Julien.”</p>

<p>“And who is Julien?”</p>

<p>“He is my brother.”</p>

<p>“But how does it happen that you go alone?”</p>

<p>“I have none to accompany me.”</p>

<p>“Have you neither father nor mother?”</p>

<p>“Non, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Does your brother know you are coming?”</p>

<p>“Non, monsieur, he does not know it. It will be a
surprise.”</p>

<p>“But what put it into your head, little—what shall
I call you? What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Julie Leblanc.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, my little Julie, how is it that you happen
to be going to America? America is a long way off, do
you know it?”</p>

<p>“But no! is it, then? It cannot be far away where
Julien is. Is it farther than Paris?”</p>

<p>“A good deal farther, Julie.”</p>

<p>“But what to do! No home, no friend. Only Julien.”</p>

<p>“No home, no friend!” repeated the captain, stroking
the dark hair, pityingly. “Did the father fall in
battle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, monsieur, many years ago, before I can remember.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>“And how long is it that little Julie has been without
home or friends?”</p>

<p>“Since they took my dear mamma away to the
burial,” answered the child, her eyes brimming with
tears.</p>

<p>After awhile the captain asked:</p>

<p>“Julie, do you know just where your brother is, in
what part of America?”</p>

<p>“In what part, monsieur? Is it then so great a
city? But, without doubt, there will be one who can
tell me where he lives. In our village one knew everybody.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed the captain, twirling his
thumbs.</p>

<p>“Or I will stand at the corner of the street until he
passes by. I shall know him, without doubt, he is so
handsome. Oh, monsieur, I would know him anywhere.
I knew him instantly the last time I saw him, although
he wore the clothes of Jacques, the mason.”</p>

<p>As the captain seemed interested, Julie explained:</p>

<p>“I awoke in the night. It was the dear mamma who
stood by my bed with a candle in the hand, and one
with her like Jacques until I meet his beautiful eyes.
Then I laugh gaily and cry, ‘Ah, behold thee, my brother,
covered with plaster! and thy coat too large for
thee! Didst thou think to fool me?’ But our mother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
lays the finger upon her lip, and her face is very pale;
and Julien kisses and embraces me without ceasing, and
with tears, and I know not what to make of it. Soon
they go out and I fall again to sleep. Oh, monsieur,
he came that same night to America! It was not an
hour after, while I slept—mamma has told me it—that
the wicked gendarmes came and searched the house for
him!”</p>

<p>“Ah! the gendarmes! and why?”</p>

<p>“Because—mamma said—he had written something
in the journals which meant that the Emperor was not
a good Emperor; and for <em>that</em> the wicked gendarmes
would have put my poor brother in prison.”</p>

<p>“Go on, my pretty one,” said the captain, smiling,
“thou knowest how to talk. Thou art more entertaining
than a book. How old art thou?”</p>

<p>“Ten years.”</p>

<p>“You are small for that age. Have you ever been to
school?”</p>

<p>“Never, monsieur. It was the governess who taught
me.”</p>

<p>“The governess—bah! Did she ever see a geography?”</p>

<p>“Geography, monsieur? What is that? Is it an
animal?”</p>

<p>“Bah! What did she teach you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>“The dance, and the drawing, and the embroidery,
and the music—”</p>

<p>“The music?—can you sing?”</p>

<p>“A little, monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Sing me, then, a little song.”</p>

<p>So Julie sang a little song. It was the “Farewell.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Adieu! ne m’oublie pas, etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Bravo!” applauded the captain when she had finished.
Then he went up on deck.</p>

<p>Julie recollected something as he passed out. She
carefully drew a small package from the folds of her
dress and ran after him. The rolling of the ship made
her dizzy. She reeled and would have fallen, had not
a sailor caught her hand.</p>

<p>“Merci” (thank you), she said.</p>

<p>That brought another to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Merci, merci!” she repeated.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of the crew came to learn the cause of
alarm.</p>

<p>“Merci, merci, merci!” she screamed. Would they
never understand?</p>

<p>The captain did, and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“And what can I do for mademoiselle?” he asked
as she approached, smiling at sight of his bronzed and
furrowed face—already that of an old friend among
this crowd of seamen—strangers, from a country where
“mercy!” is a frequent exclamation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

  <p class="caption">“Because this, mamma said, must pay for my
voyage.”—<span class="smcap"><a href="#Page_99">Page 99.</a></span></p>
</div>

<p>“Good monsieur, are you the man who takes the
moneys? Because this, mamma said, must pay for my
voyage.” She gave to him the little parcel.</p>

<p>The captain opened it, and found therein a beautiful
cross of solid gold, curiously wrought and thickly studded
with precious stones.</p>

<p>“Will it not do, monsieur? There was nothing else.
No money. The woman demanded so much for the
room and all! Poor mamma was so long sick! Oh,
monsieur, monsieur, but for that—if she had not been
sick, she also would have come to America—to Julien!
‘Take it,’ she said—all so slow—she whispered it all
so slow—‘Take it and go to Julien. It will pay the
passage.’ And she whispered still a little more. I
could not hear. But I thought she went to sleep.
When the morning came, and I could see her face—so
pale! so cold! so still—”</p>

<p>“Here, my little Julie,” interrupted the captain,
pressing his hand an instant over his eyes, “take thy
cross. Keep it. Thou shalt have it to remember her
by. And I—I am very well pleased to have a little
passenger.”</p>

<p>“Oh, mon oncle! how good you are!” and the child
covered his great brown hand with kisses.</p>

<p>The captain stooped to rub her soft cheek with his
grizzled beard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>He had no reason to be surprised; for wherever he
went, the wide world over, did not all children call him
“Uncle?”</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>“When was it your brother went away, Julie?—how
long ago? can you remember?” the captain asked one
day as the little girl paced the deck at his side, her
slender hand in his.</p>

<p>“It is a very long time, monsieur mon oncle,” she
answered; and after thinking, “it is a year.”</p>

<p>“Now try to remember, if you can, something about
the place where he lives. Did he never tell you about
it?—did he write no letters?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, mon oncle; often to our mother, and for
me, one time, a little letter—all in an envelope by
itself. Always I carry it with me. Behold it!” she
said, drawing it from her pocket.</p>

<p>“Ah! a letter!” cried the captain, greatly relieved,
“that will help us.”</p>

<p>It was dated six months before, and postmarked
“Philadelphia.” Within, too, was given the name of
the street, and even the number of the residence.</p>

<p>“Ah!” gasped the captain, more relieved than ever.</p>

<p>As soon as the vessel arrived in port, he addressed
some lines to Julie’s brother. But as the days passed
and he received no answer, he went himself to Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
and to the street and number given in the letter.
No. 210 proved to be a boarding-house, where,
indeed, the person inquired for had stopped a short
time. He had, however, gone away long ago, whither,
no one could tell. The captain then inserted in the
newspapers a card asking information concerning his
whereabouts. While waiting a reply, there came
orders to sail with a cargo for the West Indies. (The
captain’s was a trading vessel, carrying merchandise
from one country to another.)</p>

<p>What was to be done with little Julie? that was the
question. The captain went finally to a lawyer, told
him her story, charged him to make inquiries for her
brother. Then they talked awhile together, and the
lawyer did some writing.</p>

<p>After that the captain took Julie in the cars to a
town where lived a friend of his. Now, his friend, his
wife, and their five children were delighted to see the
captain. They always were when he came home from
his voyages. Perhaps it was because he never failed
to bring such costly presents; this time a beautiful
gilt harness for the father—or rather for a pair of fine
bays—elegant French silks for the mother, and no end
of toys for the small folks. And when he asked Mrs.
Lane if she would, as a favor, take Julie into her home
and care for her until his return (he did not expect to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
be gone long, he said), she appeared to be very willing
to do so.</p>

<p>But when it came to bidding “good-bye,” and the
child clung to him, trembling and sobbing, “Oh, mon
oncle! mon oncle!” he looked troubled. He just held
her close for a moment, gave her three great sailor
kisses that echoed from cellar to garret, and ran out of
the house without a word.</p>

<p>No sooner had the captain’s ship set sail than Mrs.
Lane took Julie to an orphan asylum.</p>

<p>“Send her off somewhere,” she said to the matron.
“A home in the West! that would be the very place
for her. Ah, the West! what a glorious place for little
homeless wanderers!”</p>

<p>Riding away alone in her easy carriage, she muttered:</p>

<p>“The <em>i</em>dea of his bringing that little vagabond for
<em>me</em> to look after! I don’t care if he <em>did</em> offer to pay
her board (of course it wouldn’t have done to accept).
I don’t intend to make my house a harbor for every
little straggler that happens along! and right there
with the children, too! What do I know about her?
What does he? Maybe her story is true, and maybe
it isn’t. Those French, they can lie! And then she’d
be forever harassing me about that brother of hers.
Ha! she’ll never see <em>him</em> again! those French!...
And then he’s taken such a fancy to her!—why, she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
calls him ‘Uncle’ already! Just like him to go and
spend upon her the half he owns—educate her, and all
that! I won’t have it!... There may be some
trouble over my sending her off?... Well, well,
I’ll have some pretty excuse ready. Time enough to
invent it before he gets back.”</p>

<p>(It was thought that the captain would make the
little Lanes his heirs, for they were great favorites with
“Uncle Jack.”)</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>At the asylum, little orphans had a roof to shelter
them from the storms, a place to lay their tired selves
at night, food to eat when they were hungry, clothes to
protect them from the cold. But there was no mamma
there, no Julien, no oncle le capitaine. The great
clean rooms, with their whitewashed walls, were so
bare. No pretty mats on the floors, no carved tables,
no silken chairs and sofas, no crimson curtains, no beautiful
paintings and statuettes, as in that pleasant village
home from which Julie and her mother fled when the
terrible armies came marching on, with beat of drum
and thundering of cannon. It was dreary and lonesome
here. Julie could not understand a word that
was spoken, neither could any one understand her.
So she could not play with the other children, but sat
alone by herself watching them all day—watching in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
dream, the roar of the briny billows still ringing in her
ears. Now and then she cried a little for very homesickness;
and always she wondered why she was in this
place and why Julien did not come.</p>

<p>One day a lady was shown into the school-room,
where the children sang for her. Looking about upon
their faces she asked:</p>

<p>“Who is that delicate little creature in the corner,
with the dark hair and eyes?”</p>

<p>The matron told the story she had heard from Mrs.
Lane. It was, she said, a little orphan girl who had recently
come over in an emigrant ship from France. Her
father was killed in the battle of Sedan. Did the lady
know of any one who would like to adopt the child?</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve a great mind to take her myself. She
could play with Charlie and Lizzie, you know,” turning
to her companion, “and in that way they could learn to
speak French, couldn’t they?”</p>

<p>So, when this person—she was visiting some cousins
in town—when she returned home Julie went with her;
why, she did not know, but she supposed it must be the
way to find her brother. To be sure, madame let her
hold Lizzie a good deal, and holding Lizzie made one’s
arms ache. What matter? Julien would be there,
where they were going!</p>

<p>But when the long journey was ended, and they left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
the noisy train, and monsieur met them, all smiles at
the sight of wife and baby, and they drove through the
streets to monsieur’s house, Julien was not there! The
child was ready to cry from disappointment. She sat
down by the window and watched the passers-by. Perhaps
one would be Julien. Now, a little boy of five or
six years, after being fondled and caressed by mamma,
and having given baby a dutiful but hasty kiss, came
and planted himself in front of her. When he had stared
at her to his satisfaction, he demanded:</p>

<p>“Who be <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p>Julie could not understand, and so how could she
answer?</p>

<p>“Who be <em>you</em>, I say?”</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you speak, you ninny, you?”</p>

<p>“Bonjour, mon ami,”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> said Julie, scared at his rough
tones.</p>

<p>“Bonny Jew!—what’s the rest of it? Bonny Jew!
Bonny Jew! Ha, ha! What a funny name!”</p>

<p>Charley caught up his cap and ran into the street to
tell Willie Wade:</p>

<p>“There’s a girl in there. Her name’s Bonny Jew.
She’s deef, I guess, fur I couldn’t make ’er hear till I
hollered loud enough to take ’er head off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>At night, madame led Julie down to the kitchen, saying,
“Katrine, you may let her sleep with you,” and
left her there.</p>

<p>Katrine’s face flushed scarlet, and her mild eyes
flashed as they never flashed before. Was not France
at that very hour making war upon her countrymen?
Were not all French, then, her enemies? She took up
the lamp and strode toward her chamber. Julie, afraid
to be left in the dark, followed after. The door was
locked in her face.</p>

<p>Madame coming into the basement for a glass of water,
late in the evening, stumbled over the child lying
asleep on the hall floor, just outside of Katrine’s room.
She tried the door, and finding it fastened, called
through the keyhole: “Katrine! Katrine!”</p>

<p>Katrine either did not hear or pretended not to. She
was snoring right loyally between two immense feather
beds which had kept her company all the way from Vaterland.
The lounge in the back parlor, with some shawls
and cushions, would serve for Julie’s couch this time.</p>

<p>“Katrine,” asked madame, “what did you mean by
locking Julie out of your room last night?”</p>

<p>“I vill not haf der Franchen mit me in my ped!”</p>

<p>“Why, Katrine, I think you are very unreasonable.”</p>

<p>“I care not vat you tinks! I vill go find me anodder
blace!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>But madame couldn’t afford to lose Katrine. Katrine
was a treasure. Katrine could cook, and wash, and iron,
and do all kinds of work to perfection. She was tidy,
and she was industrious, and always good-tempered till
now. So, instead of her finding “anodder blace,” a bed
was made for Julie in the attic—the low, wide, windowless
attic, where not a breath of air moved in summer,
where the winds whistled and moaned in winter,
where the rats and mice held revels all the year round—the
great, gloomy attic, with its mysterious chests
and closets, where curious shadows dwelt; strewn with
mysterious hats, and boots and shoes, that took strange
shapes after the sun went down; hung about with mysterious
outcasts—old gowns, and crinolines, and coats,
that weirdly swayed and swung on boisterous autumn
nights; the dreadful attic, where, hour after hour, when
she ought to have been enjoying sweet, blessed sleep,
little tired Julie lay wide-eyed, staring at—she knew
not what, listening to—she knew not what, trembling,
shivering, the sweat upon her brow.</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, <i>j’ai peur</i>!”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> she said once, lingering
when bedtime came.</p>

<p>But madame didn’t understand.</p>

<p>The weeks passed by. Julien did not come. Would
he ever come? The question was often put to madame.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
But she didn’t understand. Julie began to grow discouraged.
Baby was so heavy! and she was cutting
teeth, too, and worried and fretted. Some new plaything
must be invented every five minutes to amuse
and keep her quiet. She must be sung to, rocked, carried
backward and forward, to and fro, drawn in her
carriage up and down the sidewalk, wearily, wearily, up
and down. As for Charley, he learned to speak less
good French of Julie than he hurled bad English at her.
During his mother’s visit East, he had improved the
chance for making acquaintance with all the boys on
the street, and thus had considerably increased the list
of words at his command. One day, Lizzie’s dimpled
fingers found the ribbon about Julie’s neck. Out in
full sight flew the precious cross. Julie hastened to
hide it, but a pair of keen eyes had caught the glitter.</p>

<p>“What’s that? What’s that shiny thing you’ve got
there, Julie? I want to see it!” cried the tormentor,
darting toward her.</p>

<p>She thrust out her hand to keep him off. He flung
it aside and clutched at the ribbon.</p>

<p>“Non! non!” she screamed, pushing him away.</p>

<p>At that he became furious, kicking and biting, and
pulling her hair. Julie, dropping the baby, shrieked
with pain. Baby began to cry lustily. The uproar
reached the drawing-room, where there were callers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
Madame came rushing in to still the noise. Charley,
who had succeeded in tearing it away, now, triumphant,
held up the cross.</p>

<p>“See, ma, see! She had it hid in ’er neck! She
stole it, you bet!”</p>

<p>“Oh, donnez-la moi! donnez-la moi!”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> sobbed
Julie.</p>

<p>Madame hadn’t time to inquire into the matter.
She took the cross away from Charley, though he
stoutly resisted, locked it in a drawer of her writing-desk,
put the key in her pocket and then went back to
her guests.</p>

<p>The young gentleman picked at the lock with his
pencil.</p>

<p>“You plagued old thing!” he muttered, shaking his
fist and scowling at Julie, “if you hadn’t a’ raised such
a rumpus she’d never a’ knowed, and I’d a’ traded it off
fur Tommy Tough’s pearl-handled penknife—plague
take you!”</p>

<p>After the visitors had gone, Julie, pointing to the
writing-desk, entreated:</p>

<p>“Oh, madame, la give, la give! à present, s’il vous
please!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes, by and by.”</p>

<p>But “by and by,” madame had forgotten. She did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
not remember, indeed, until she opened the drawer to
get her portemonnaie before going out shopping.</p>

<p>“Some cheap gew-gaw, possibly,” she thought,
taking up the cross. “I don’t know, though! Can
this be glass? Wonder how she came by it? Can it
possibly be of any value?... I’ve a great mind to take
it down to Forsyth’s and see what he says. <em>He</em>’ll know
the moment he lays eyes on it.”</p>

<p>Down to Forsyth’s she took it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Forsyth,” she said, handing it across the counter,
“here is a little trinket that has accidentally come
into my possession lately. I’d like your opinion as to
its worth.”</p>

<p>The jeweler’s eyes sparkled like the precious gems,
as he held them to the light.</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. ——, you have here a treasure! Those
stones!—genuine article!” and examining more closely:
“It’s very old. Just observe the chasing. You know
nothing of its history?”</p>

<p>“No. You consider it of value, then?”</p>

<p>“Of value? I would give five hundred dollars any
day, Mrs. ——, to become possessor of that cross.” He
added eagerly, “Could you not be induced to part with
it?”</p>

<p>Five hundred dollars! Madame’s glance fell upon
a silver tea-service which she had long coveted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“Possibly. I’ll think about it,” she said, and went
her way.</p>

<p>Such a lovely blue moire in one of the shop windows—five
dollars a yard. It made one’s mouth water to
look at it. Such a lovely Brussels in another!—the
parlors needed carpeting anew. Such lovely, lovely
things in all the windows! that one really <em>ought</em> to have.
As for the child, of what earthly use could that costly
trinket ever be to <em>her</em>? Like as not she stole it, as
Charley said.</p>

<p>When madame reached home her purse was even
better filled than when she started out, and the silver
tea-set would be sent up from Forsyth’s to-morrow.
Meantime a curious piece of workmanship in the jeweler’s
show-case was attracting much attention.</p>

<p class="tb">What a queer way to find the brother is this—tending
Lizzie and being knocked about by Charley, and
robbed of mamma’s last gift! Julie fears she will
never get it, for when she asked madame for it again,
madame blushed and did not reply. What strange
people these Americans are! They make little children
take care of little children! And she is afraid of
Charley. She trembles now to think of him. And
who is that creature peering out of the closet over
there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>It is like the woman who let the room where mamma
was taken sick.</p>

<p>Why, this is that room! and here is the mother beside
her.</p>

<p>Julie leans over and asks:</p>

<p>“Why dost thou not waken, my mother? Behold,
the sun is high. Why dost thou sleep so long? Why
art thou so cold and pale? Mamma! Mamma!”</p>

<p>The silken lashes are not lifted from the marble
cheek; the white lips make no answer.</p>

<p>“She is so weary, I will not disturb her. I will
watch until she wakens.”</p>

<p>The morning creeps away, the noon, and the afternoon,
and now the evening comes.</p>

<p>“Mamma! my dear mamma!”</p>

<p>Still the eyelids are not lifted, and the white lips are
dumb.</p>

<p>The night goes by, and a day, and another night, and
the morning dawns once more. And again the woman
comes peering through the door.</p>

<p>“She is dead,” Julie hears her say.</p>

<p>Men enter and carry the mother away.</p>

<p>“Where are you going with my poor mamma?”</p>

<p>“We are going to bury her.”</p>

<p>“You shall not bury her! You shall not take her
away,” cries Julie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>They thrust her back with rough hands. They will
not let her follow. The woman locks her in. She is
left alone, alone.</p>

<p>The day goes by, the noon, and the afternoon. The
shadows reach out after her like claws. She crouches
in the chimney-corner, staring at them through the
long, dark hours.</p>

<p>At midnight the woman glides stealthily in, glides
stealthily about, peering, peering with wicked eyes.
She fumbles among the bedding, opens the trunk, takes
out its contents carefully.</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing!” she hisses between clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>She glides stealthily towards the child. Julie holds
the cross in her hand.</p>

<p>“What have you there, little wretch?” demands the
woman, trying to wrest it from her.</p>

<p>Julie will not give it up. With a sudden bound she
escapes, runs out of the room, out of the house, down
the path, away, away, through the fields. On, and on,
she hurries, not daring to look back. Daylight comes,
and still she walks on. After awhile she grows faint.
She sits down by the roadside to rest. A peasant girl
passes by with a basket on her arm.</p>

<p>“Does this road go to the place where one finds the
ships?” asked Julie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span></p>

<p>“Oui, mademoiselle.”</p>

<p>When Julie is rested, she rises and walks on. Still
on and on. The way is long. At last the houses are
thick together. Beyond is the blue sea. There are the
ships, many, with white sails.</p>

<p>“Which one goes to America?” asks Julie of a man
lounging about the wharf.</p>

<p>He points to one from which floats a beautiful flag.</p>

<p>While she looks, the great flag comes fluttering,
fluttering down—fluttering, floating before her, floating
about her, wrapping her in its folds; then back
it flies, whizzing through the air, up, up, up, among the
tall masts, so high above the water! Julie is dizzy,
and tries to catch at the ropes. Lo! her hands are
pinioned. She cannot move them. A huge serpent is
coiled about her—a huge serpent striped its whole
length with red and white. The coils are tightening,
tightening. She cannot breathe. She struggles to be
free. A flaming head swoops suddenly down. Two
terrible eyes glare at her—two eyes—two glittering
stars.</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>“Katrine,” said madame, “go and call Julie. Why,
here it’s seven o’clock, and she not up yet! I never
knew her to lie abed like this before. Tell her she
must come down right away and dress the baby.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>Katrine came back in a few minutes, looking frightened.</p>

<p>“I calls von, dwo, dree dimes. She vill not hear.
Den I goes oop der shtep und calls von more dime.
She vill not ondershtand. She shtare mit de eyes
vide—und see notting! Den she schream like murter.”</p>

<p>“Why, mercy on us, Dolf!” exclaimed madame,
glancing across the breakfast-table at her husband,
“what if the child’s sick! some fever or other!—something
catching!—and these children!—she ought
to be got out of the house immediately!... St. Mary’s
Hospital! Yes, that’s the place. She’s Catholic, I believe.
Katrine!—no, wait! perhaps it isn’t anything
serious, after all. We must find out first. Dolf, what
if you leave word for Dr. Smith to call round as you go
down street? No, stay!” in an undertone, “don’t
send <em>him</em>. Get some one that doesn’t go in our set—some
stranger. Being up in the attic so, it might get
out that we didn’t treat her well. You know how absurdly
people will talk, sometimes. Can’t you think
of some one else we can call in?”</p>

<p>“Well, I d-o-n’-t know. Let me see. Why, yes,
there’s that young fellow who has stuck up his shingle
a few doors off from the office. Foreigner, I believe.
Hasn’t any too much custom, should judge.
Might get him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“A foreigner. Oh, yes; that will do very well.”</p>

<p>In half an hour the young physician rang the door-bell.
He was shown up to the attic by Katrine. As
he mounted the stairs, a pitiful little wail came floating
down:</p>

<p>“Oh, Julien, Julien, tu es bien longtemps à venir.
Helas! ne te reverrai-je plus?”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Madame, waiting below, wondered if the stranger
wasn’t “some exiled nobleman, he looks so distinguished.
Rather seedy, though.”</p>

<p>Soon she grew impatient.</p>

<p>“What is he keeping me so long in suspense for,
I should like to know?”</p>

<p>When he came down at last, his eyes burned like hot
coals, and he had for her questions never a word of
answer. He walked swiftly away, and returned with a
carriage before she had recovered from her amazement.
Still speechless, he again made his way to the attic,
and when he descended this time he bore something
in his arms very tenderly.</p>

<p>It was little Julie, wrapped in his cloak.</p>

<p>“You are behaving very strangely, sir! What are
you doing? Where are you taking her?”</p>

<p>“Where she will be cared for, rest assured!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean, sir?” cried madame, following
down the steps. “Do you dare insinuate that she
wouldn’t be cared for here? I want to know what
right you have to be meddling with that child?”</p>

<p>“The best right in the world, madame—a brother’s
right.” To the coachman: “Drive on!” and the carriage
rolled away.</p>

<p>A passing glimpse of a tiny, fever-flushed face, wild,
unconscious, restless eyes, and lips that moved continually,
was the last madame saw of the “delicate little
creature” she had “adopted” for a nurse-girl.</p>

<p>When she had recovered breath and collected her
scattered wits, she put on her shawl and bonnet, and
went down town to the office.</p>

<p>“Dolf, what’s that young doctor’s name, do you
know?”</p>

<p>“Name? Never noticed, ’pon my word. Why?”</p>

<p>“It’s out there on his door, or somewhere, isn’t it?
Just step out and see, please.”</p>

<p>“Leblanc,” said “Dolf,” returning.</p>

<p>“Leblanc—Leblanc ... yes, and that’s the child’s
name, now I recall it. Do you know, he’s her brother!”</p>

<p>The next place madame visited was the jeweler’s.
She was very glad she had not purchased the watered
silk or the Brussels carpet, and that the silver service
had not yet been sent up to the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Forsyth,” she said, laying a roll of bank-notes
on the counter, “I regret our little transaction yesterday.
I prefer to keep the cross myself.”</p>

<p>“Well—a—hem!—a bargain’s a bargain, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk to me about ‘bargains’! we’re old
acquaintances. I want that cross. I <em>must</em> have it.”</p>

<p>The jeweler colored, and coughed, and objected. But
madame was obstinate. Finally, as they were “old acquaintances,”
and as madame’s husband was a lawyer,
and as he hadn’t told her anywhere near the full value
of the cross, he yielded—on one condition—that it
should remain a few days longer in his show-case. It
added greatly to the display there, especially since a
card had been attached to it, reading thus:</p>

<p class="cross"><span class="allsmcap">ANTIQUE CROSS,</span><br />
Formerly owned by the<br />
EMPRESS EUGENIE,<br />
<i>Sold by her in her flight from Paris, to defray the expenses of the journey.</i></p>

<p>Madame agreed to the condition, thinking:</p>

<p>“If Doctor Leblanc cares anything for his sister he
won’t be gaping at jewelers’ windows for some time to
come. (Doubtful if she recovers. It’s some fever or
other she must have caught on board that emigrant
ship. And the children! bless me, I must go the very
next thing to Doctor Smith and see if he thinks there’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
any danger.) And then if he shouldn’t happen to ask
for it, or make any fuss about it, why, I can wear it
myself, and everybody in town will suppose it has once
been worn by Eugenie!”</p>

<p class="tb">A week from that morning little Julie came back
from her wanderings, looked up into the face bending
over her, and knew it for the first time.</p>

<p>“C’est lui!”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> she whispered, smiling faintly, closed
her weary eyes and fell into a sweet slumber.</p>

<p>“Thank God! she is going to live.”</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> Thou art very long in coming. Alas! shall I never see thee
more?</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> It is he!</p>
</div>

</div>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>“What art thou writing, my brother?” asked Julie
from among her pillows one day; “something for the
journals?”</p>

<p>“Oui, cherie.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Julien, take care! do not say that the
Emperor of America is not a good Emperor!”</p>

<p>“Fear not, mon enfant: we are in a free country
where one says what one pleases.”</p>

<p>Julien brought a basin which had been heating on
the stove.</p>

<p>“Here is something for thee, little one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“Wilt thou not have of it also, brother? Let us
dine together. I never see thee eat.”</p>

<p>“The beef tea is not for strong men: it is for the
little invalids.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but thou art not strong! I remember when
thy cheeks were like the rose. Now thou art so pale
and thin! and I saw thy hand tremble while thou wast
writing. Oh, my brother, if thou shouldst be sick, I
fear I could not be to thee the good angel thou art to
me. Come, take of this a little: it is excellent.”</p>

<p>“I have already dined, cherie.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“While thou wast sleeping.”</p>

<p>“I bet thy dinner was not so good as mine! n’est ce
pas?”</p>

<p>No, truly it was not. It was of stale bread, as wee a
morsel as ever kept body and soul together. But the
little one must never know.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Julie, who is oncle le capitaine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is the monsieur charming who gave me a
ride in his ship. He promised to find thee for me. But
who hast thou heard to speak of him?”</p>

<p>“A little fairy. And so he gave thee the ride?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Julien, was he not good? He would not take
the cross—thou rememberest?—our poor mamma’s
beautiful cross. It was yesterday, was it not, that I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
was telling thee how she gave it to me? Madame
locked it in the drawer. I wonder if she would not let
thee have it if thou wert to ask her? for thou art a
man, and thou canst speak English, and she will comprehend.
Oh, dear Julien, what is the matter? what
have I said? art thou angry with me?”</p>

<p>“No, not with thee, my poor dear little angel! but
with those people there—the brutes!”</p>

<p>“Comment! who has told thee of them, my brother?”</p>

<p>“A little fairy.”</p>

<p>“Who is that little fairy that tells thee so much?
what is she called?”</p>

<p>“She is called Julie.”</p>

<p>“Comment! what dost thou say? I am she! But
how could I tell thee, since thou wilt scarcely allow me
to speak a single word, dear monsieur le docteur?”</p>

<p>“My poor little Julie has had bad dreams and talked
in her sleep. There, now, thou art weary. Close thy
pretty eyes and rest thee. Already, I fear, I have let
thee talk too long.”</p>

<p>“But it is so good to be with one who comprehends,
and can speak with me our own beautiful language!”</p>

<p>“Poor little sister! when thou art stronger, we will
do nothing but talk for a whole day.”</p>

<p>While the child lay sleeping, there came a rap at the
outer door. Julien hoped he was going to have a patient.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
But no, a tall, stout gentleman strode into the
office. His face was ruddy, his eyes twinkled merrily.
He didn’t look as if he were in any need of medicine.</p>

<p>“I came to ask after the little Julie,” he said. “She
came over in my ship,” he explained. “Possibly she
has made mention of—”</p>

<p>“Ah! is it ‘oncle le capitaine’?”</p>

<p>“The same,” answered the gentleman, smiling.</p>

<p>“Then let me thank you for your kindness to my
little sister!” cried the young man, grasping his hand.
“I know not how to express my gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Bah! where is she?”</p>

<p>“In the next room. She sleeps. She is just recovering
from a fever—of the brain.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Strange that woman should not have
spoken of it! Has she been very sick?”</p>

<p>“It has been a struggle for life.”</p>

<p>“Ah-h-h, those Lanes! the rascals! Why, sir, I left
the child in charge of people I thought I could trust—people
I had befriended. Why, that man, Lane, was
head and ears in debt! but for me, he and his would
be in want and misery to-day! What do they do, the
moment I am out of sight, but send her to an orphan
asylum! Sent her off! off West! that was all they
could tell me at the asylum. Gone West! Nothing
definite. No record, no trace. I’ve had a search, I can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
tell you. Hunted, advertised, from place to place.
Yesterday I came here. It was by this cross I found
her. I saw it in a shop window and identified it at
once with one little Julie had shown me on shipboard.
You recognize it?”</p>

<p>“I do, indeed. It is an heir-loom. It has been
handed down through I know not how many generations.”</p>

<p>“I made inquiries in the shop, and was directed to
a lady who they said was its owner. She proved to be
the person who took the child from the asylum. She
seemed strangely embarrassed and disinclined to speak
about the matter.”</p>

<p>“With good reason! mon Dieu! my blood boils as I
think of it. It was the cruelty and overtask that
caused my little one’s illness.”</p>

<p>“I suspected something of the kind. Listen to the
condition upon which that person acquainted me with
your whereabouts—that I ‘shouldn’t mention the matter
to any one in town!’ And there’s something
wrong about this cross. She said she was afraid the
child might lose it, and so had put it under lock and
key for safe keeping, and had afterwards lent it to the
jeweler as a curiosity. But he was wonderfully inquisitive,
and undertook to pump me when I went back
after it. What do you think he had labeled it? As one
of the jewels of your ex-Empress!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“C’en est trop!<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> these Yankees!” exclaimed Julien;
then coloring to the roots of his hair he stammered:</p>

<p>“Pardon, monsieur!”</p>

<p>“No offense,” said the captain, smiling. “I am, then,
so genuine a Yankee?”</p>

<p>“I do not say it,” the other slowly answered.</p>

<p>The captain laughed aloud.</p>

<p>Julien opened the inner door.</p>

<p>“Didst thou call, sister?”</p>

<p>“Oui, mon frere. Tell me who is with thee? But I
know it—I! It is oncle le capitaine! I heard him
laugh!”</p>

<p>“Bonjour, bonjour, mademoiselle l’Empress! how is
your Majesty’s health to-day?” cried a voice over
Julien’s shoulder. “See, little pale one, I come to
bring thee thy cross.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the cross of mamma! the cross of mamma!”
exclaimed Julie, seizing it and covering it with kisses,
while silent tears crept down her wan cheeks.</p>

<p>Julien turned away to the window, and the captain
sat down by the couch and shaded his eyes with his
hand.</p>

<p>“But, mon oncle,” said Julie after awhile, “tell me,
did you have a good voyage? Did the great waves
come and tip the ship right over on its side and almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
spill you out? You were gone so long I feared you
were drowned. Oh, mon oncle, do not go away again
upon the terrible sea; but stay with us, my brother
and me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my little Julie, thy poor old uncle is, upon
land, like a fish out of water.”</p>

<p>Julie must not yet hear, the captain thought, the
story of that great gale off the coast of the Carolinas,
in which his good ship had nearly been wrecked. It
would better suit the little convalescent to be told of
those islands where he had been; those sunny islands
where it is always summer, where oranges and bananas
and the rarest and most beautiful flowers grow wild.</p>

<p>While the two were talking, Julien once more took
up his pen.</p>

<p>“With monsieur’s permission. An article for the
<i>Morning Post</i>. It must be ready within the next two
hours.”</p>

<p>“Ah!—a treatise on health, doubtless.”</p>

<p>“A treatise on Louis Napoleon—ce scelerat!”</p>

<p>“My friend, take the advice of your sister’s venerable
uncle; let that poor wretch alone. He’s about
played out. At all events, you are out of his reach.
Stick to your profession. Writing is fool’s business.
‘A jack at all trades is good at none.’”</p>

<p>“But monsieur knows one must find some way to kill
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Ah? Pill-peddling is not a lively business nowadays,
I take it.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur, I have set up shop in three cities, and
in each have waited three months for a patient.”</p>

<p>“Whew! is <em>that</em> so? Why didn’t you tell me before?”</p>

<p>“Why be in haste to tell of it, monsieur? It is nothing
to boast of, surely!”</p>

<p>“Why? Because I can help you. I am going to
help you. I intended to when I came here, if I found
you were in need of it.”</p>

<p>“I have not said I was in need. I ask no one for
help. What I ask for is—work!”</p>

<p>“Young man, you are altogether too proud! You
should take lessons of Young America! Young America
isn’t afraid of the jingling of coin. Young America
doesn’t spurn a good offer. Young America would
jump at the chance. But as for work, why, work will
come to you if you only wait for it long enough. ‘Patient
waiters are no losers.’”</p>

<p>“Wait, wait, wait! mon Dieu! and the child there!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must think of her! Come, my dear fellow,
you’ve had a hard row to hoe. No use denying!”</p>

<p>Julien was silent for a few moments; then he said:</p>

<p>“I will confess, monsieur, that I have seen times
when I have wished myself well back in France. There,
at least, one could fight for one’s country.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Is it worth fighting for? Poor France!—a republic,
a kingdom, an empire, a bedlam, by fits! ruled yesterday
by an idiot, to-day by a lynx, to-morrow by a pack of
bloodhounds! Better off where you are, young man;
better off where you are.”</p>

<p>Julien had arisen, and stood glaring at the captain.</p>

<p>“Monsieur forgets he is speaking of the land of my
birth!”</p>

<p>“And of the land of his birth, as well,” was the quiet
reply.</p>

<p>“Quoi! what do I understand monsieur to say?”</p>

<p>“Have you never heard your mother speak of her
brother Jean?”</p>

<p>“Often.”</p>

<p>“I am he.”</p>

<p>“But no! He entered a monastery. He was a monk.”</p>

<p>“Still again, I am he. At your age I grew weary of
the cloister. Disguised as a sailor I escaped to the
United States; and disguised as a sailor I have knocked
about the world ever since. My own country is the
one I avoid most of all. I suppose I never should
have known aught of Marguerite’s children if the
little Julie had not come to me just as she did. Indeed,
although she told me her name, I never suspected
who she might be until she showed me her poor
mother’s cross. In the cloister one is buried from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
world. I did not know whom my sister married. He,
too, is dead, the child told me. I mean your father.”</p>

<p>“General Leblanc, of the Italian campaign—you have
never heard of him? It was there that he lost his life.”</p>

<p>“Poor Marguerite! She was coming to you, it seems,
and fell ill upon the way.”</p>

<p>“I first learned it from Julie. I had received no
tidings for months. Our home was in the region which
has fallen into the enemy’s clutches. Mails, of course,
were stopped. What other reason for the silence?
Mon Dieu! the agony of suspense! I should have returned
immediately when the republic was declared,
if I could have seen my way—”</p>

<p>“And you two might have sought each other till
your locks were gray—and probably would never have
met.”</p>

<p>“Mon oncle, please tell to me also those strange, sad
things you have been telling my brother now for a long
time in that dreadful English, till suddenly, at this moment,
he looks frightened.”</p>

<p>Julien went over to the little questioner and kissed
her wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“Thy uncle, sister—dear angel!—has been telling
me that he is also <em>my</em> uncle.”</p>

</div>

<p>“Come now, my children,” said Dame Nature once,
in the morning of the world, “let me hear your voices,
that I may judge which of all is the most musical.”</p>

<p>Up from the dewy grass sprang a meadow-lark with
a burst of melody that thrilled the listening air; then
loud, and sweet, and clear, was heard the warbling of
a nightingale; the mountain brook, swinging its censer
among the rocks, began to chant—in lower, deeper
tones; meanwhile, that wanderer, the wind, passing, with
nimble fingers touched the keys of the forest-organ, and
the towering pines and sturdy oaks and yews quivered
and throbbed as he played accompaniment; then caroled
in chorus countless millions of birds—even the
tiny insects took to humming as they rioted among
the golden rays, and the wild beasts and every living
creature, encouraged, lifted their voices in trial; from
the cloud-mass, above the far-off horizon, came the
thunder’s rumble; the river, leaping the cliff, roared in
rivalry; quick followed the heavy voices of the great
billows as they came surging upon the beach. Oh, grand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
and mighty music did they all make together in that
glad morning of the world. The sunlit heavens leaned
over, breathless, to hear it, the purple valleys, lifting,
fondled it as they climbed, the speechless hills caught
it up, and in envy hurled it back again, note by note,
till the whole earth was wild with sound and deafening
reverberation, and “Cease, cease, my children!” Dame
Nature cried aloud, “lest I render you voiceless, every
one, and there be no more music forever.”</p>

<p>But failing to make herself heard, she unrolled the
great cloud that lay coiled above the horizon, and
drew it like a veil across the sky. Immediately there
was silence—silence unbroken for a moment’s space,
when “Ha, ha, ha!” giggled the mountain brook, unable
to restrain its mirth; “Ha, ha, ha!” repeated a
bright-winged forest bird; “Ha, ha, ha!” flew swiftly
back from the hills.</p>

<p>“Hush, irreverent ones!” spake Dame Nature in
anger; “listen, while I pass sentence upon you! Thou,
mountain brook, who hast dared to break silence by
thine ill-timed laughter, laugh on, forever and forever:
thy song is taken from thee, and thou shalt have thy
fill of merriment! From thee, too, bird of the brilliant
plumage, is taken the power of song: henceforth thou
shalt find voice only to mimic the folly of others. And
you, ye hills, will I fetter and bind, that ye no more astonish
the world with your envious wrath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>“As for you, my obedient children, ye are all musical,
each in his own way; and now will I assign to
you places in my choir. Thou, wandering wind, shalt
be my organist; and ye larks and nightingales, who are
my pride and joy, and all ye merry little birds, the
melody is yours; and ye surging billows, and muttering
clouds, and roaring cataracts, to you the base belongs.</p>

<p>“Sing on, now, my children; sing on, and practice
well, that ye may know your parts when, by and by, I
call upon you for a grand and glorious anthem that
shall fill the world with wonder.”</p>

<p>And alway since then they have been diligently practicing,
till now, when Dame Nature calls for <i>Te Deum</i>
at the day-dawn, or for a vesper hymn at eventide, marvelous
is the melody of gleesome and gay-hearted little
birds; marvelous is the skill of the musician wind, as
he sweeps the forest-organ’s answering keys; marvelous
are the voices of cloud and cataract, and marvelous
the voices of the sea.</p>

<p>But there are birds of rainbow-tinted plumage, wonderful
to behold, whose harsh, discordant tones serve
only to mock and mimic; the mountain brook wearies
ofttimes of laughter, querulous, complains to the rocks,
grieving for its lost song; and faint and rare are the
echoes heard among the speechless hills.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MOONSHINE">MOONSHINE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Moonshine crept down, one clear, unclouded night,
to look about the world and see what was going on.
In her hand she carried a silver lamp, by whose white
rays all objects could be seen as plainly as at noontide;
and wherever she went, the shadows, ashamed
of their blackness, stole guiltily away and tried to hide
themselves. Her path led through a forest and down
a mountain side, where wild beasts roamed for prey;
but now the timid deer browsed securely among the
underbrush, and the hungry bear trudged supperless
off to his den, the stealthy panther kept useless watch
from the branches overhead, the rattlesnake slid back
into its hole and left the tree-toads chirping cheerily,
the sly fox found the rabbits too wide awake for him;
for was not Moonshine abroad with her silver lamp,
proclaiming to all harmless creatures: Here is your
enemy, and there is your enemy?</p>

<p>On she passed till she came to a pioneer’s log cabin,
standing alone in the wide wilderness. Listening, she
heard the sound of a voice singing:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>“Ah,” said Moonshine, “the mother and her babe are
alone and unguarded in that rude dwelling. Even as
she sings her voice trembles with fear. I will set my
lamp in the window and pause awhile to keep her company.”</p>

<p>Instantly a soft radiance flooded the room within,
and the mother, looking up, beheld the gentle face
peeping through the window. “Oh, Moonshine,” she
cried, with tears of joy, “how glad am I that you have
come! Stay with me a little, for I am lonesome; and
tell me, pray, if there be any savages lurking about.”</p>

<p>Not far off a band of red men, their faces bedaubed
with paint, and their hair decked out with plumes, were
gliding noiselessly through the dense woods, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
to steal upon the cabin unawares and destroy it and its
inmates. But as soon as they saw the silver lamp upon
the window-sill, they turned away, saying: “Moonshine
is there! She would give warning of our approach.”</p>

<p>Moonshine, seeing that the dreaded enemy had
turned aside, passed on and left the mother and her
child sleeping peacefully. As swift she glided through
valley and over hill, and across river and lake and
village-dotted plain, the rays of her glittering lamp
reached far and wide through the darkness, making the
trees and gardens and rippling corn-fields glad, pointing
the shortest route to a weary boatman, revealing to
a belated traveler the robbers who stealthily pursued,
looking in upon three rosy children who slumbered
cosily in one couch together—stooping to kiss their
shining curls and happy faces, and to whisper something
pleasant in their ears. Nor did she pause when
she came to the great sea, but glided on over the foaming
billows. A white-sailed ship the winds were driving
towards an unknown reef. Quickly she set her silver
lamp upon the perilous rock. Far over the angry
waters shone the beacon light, and the mariners, seeing
danger ahead, shifted their sails and changed the vessel’s
course.</p>

<p>The wanderer reached, at length, a distant coast, and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
holding her lamp aloft, passed on from town to town.
A student sat at midnight, wakeful among his books.
Moonshine glanced over his shoulder at the closely-printed
page, and the light of her silver lamp so put to
shame his miserable taper that he extinguished it, and
began to write some verses in her praise.</p>

<p>At last, Moonshine peered down into a deep, dark
dungeon, and saw a hapless human creature bound with
chains. Pale and wan he was, from long years of imprisonment.
For hours she remained to speak to him
comforting words.</p>

<p>In the morning the pioneer came to his home on the
mountain side, and told how he had been rescued by
Moonshine from highwaymen who pursued him as he
journeyed. “Ah, bless her,” said the wife; “for she
also watched over us, and guarded us while we slept.”
The three rosy children awakened smiling, and told
one another their dreams; they had all dreamed of fairy-land.
The storm-tossed ship sailed into port, and the
grateful mariners declared that, but for Moonshine,
they would have gone to the bottom of the sea. The
student went about with such a beaming countenance
that people questioned, Was he moonstruck? A jailer,
descending into a deep, dark dungeon, found the
fettered captive lying silent, with closed eyes; and the
sad soul that had gazed out of those eyes—who had
set it free? Moonshine?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SUNSHINE">SUNSHINE.</h2>

</div>

<p>“<i>Voila, Jeannette! voila!</i>”</p>

<p>The little old woman lifts her wrinkled face from the
lace-work over which she is bending, and looks where
the slender hand just pointed. How did it come there,
that sunbeam? So the two question; for never, in all
the time they have occupied the low, dim room, with its
one window, has a sunbeam shone into it, warm and
cheery, like that. Possibly some recent alteration in
the high buildings without has made way for the welcome
visitor, now that the sun has moved farther
around to the north. However it came there, there it
is, the mellow ray, deepening in color as the sun sinks
lower down, changing from yellow to orange, from
orange to rose. The couch must be moved nearer, so
that the thin hand may press the wall and feel the warm
light as it rests there; then a smile wreathes the wan,
weary young face, and its owner goes off dreaming—dreaming
with eyes wide open.</p>

<p>Somebody knocks at the door. “Coom,” calls Jeannette.
A lad of twelve lifts the latch and enters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span></p>

<p>“Is this the place where they mend lace, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“Yes. <i>C’est moi.</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, they sent a lot in this bundle. They said
they wanted it done right away, if you could. It’s a
curtain. The kitten tore it, I guess. He’s always
scampering up the curtains.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” (Yes is one of the few English words Jeannette
is quite sure about, so she seldom adds to it in
her replies, when she can avoid doing so.)</p>

<p>“When shall I come after it?”</p>

<p>“Maunday—next—week,” Jeannette slowly answers,
and takes the package the lad has brought.</p>

<p>His errand is done; why does he linger? Have the
brown eyes, in a rapid glance or two, taken in more
than they would if they were not so big and generous?
The low ceiling with the laths bared of plaster here and
there, the scant furniture, the tumble-down stove, the
uneven, uncarpeted floor, the plants in the window—sickly
for lack of light—the withered little lace-mender
shivering in her shawl for lack of fire, the boy on the
couch yonder, clutching at a sunbeam, gazing dreamily
into space; he has seen all; he has heard the hollow
cough, he winks hard to keep from taking the decided
shape of tears something that for an instant dims his
bonny eyes.</p>

<p>“Has he been sick a good while?” he whispers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” says Jeannette, and calls, “Ernest!”</p>

<p>Ernest comes out of his dream. The great dark, sorrowful
eyes meet the great bright, generous ones. In
a twinkling young America, with lusty health and
blooming cheeks, is at the bedside of—young France,
shall we say?</p>

<p>An hour after Ned hastens home to his sister with
the story he has just heard.</p>

<p>“Belle,” he cries, as he bursts into the parlor, “you
know where you sent me this afternoon—to that French
woman’s? Well, they’re poor as can be. And he’s
sick, too. And no doctor, no medicine, no nothing!
Wish I was as rich as Crœsus!”</p>

<p>“He? Who’s he?”</p>

<p>“Why, Ernest. His father was an artist, you see;
and they came to this country, and his pictures
wouldn’t sell, and he couldn’t get work, and he got discouraged
and drowned himself. Then, after awhile, his
mother died, and Jeannette—she’s a servant who came
with them—she stays with him and takes care of him.
He’s got the consumption and coughs awfully. <em>I</em> know
what’s done it! Starving! and freezing! Guess what
he was doing! Warming his hands in the sunshine!”</p>

<p>“Well, did she say when she would have the window
curtain finished?”</p>

<p>Where shall one go for sympathy and help? There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
is no mother. The father is a hundred miles away, engaged
as counsel in the settlement of a disputed estate
(if anybody knows what all that means). The live-long
night Ned lies awake, thinking the matter over something
after this fashion:</p>

<p>“There’s that house—corner of South and High
Street. Rooms to let—noticed the advertisement to-day.
Nice rooms. Plenty of light. Just <em>the</em> place!...
Wish I was rich as Crœsus!... What did I want to
go and throw away my last allowance that way for?
Haven’t got a red cent left! Don’t know where it’s all
gone to, now! Got a lot of trinkets that aren’t of much
use to me, anyhow. Cut my thumb half off with my
jack-knife first time I used it; broke all the strings to
my violin before I’d had it a week; and made myself
about sick trying to smoke cigars.... Wish I was
rich as Crœsus!”</p>

<p>When, next morning, Ned meets on the street his
elderly friend, the physician, who helped him comfortably
through with the measles, mumps and whooping
cough, and is greeted with, “Why, young man,
there’s a cloud on your face—what’s the trouble?” he
answers, “Come and see,” and leads to a dismal quarter
of the town, and from one story to another of a
dismal tenement, till they reach the chamber where
Ernest lies. When they are down in the street again,
Ned takes up the old refrain—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>“Wish I was rich as Crœsus. We’d get him out of
there and cure him up, wouldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Ah, my boy, if we had the wealth of twenty Crœsuses
it’s too late to help him now. The best we can do
is to make him as comfortable as possible where he is.
Come round to the office with me, and I’ll give you
something to ease the cough a little.”</p>

<p>When the medicine is ready Ned rises to go, but
hesitates.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any fire there, Doctor. I’ve used up
all my last allowance, and father’s away from home.
What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>The Doctor writes down some names and addresses
on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>“There. You go to these gentlemen, state the case,
and we’ll see what they’ll do for you.... I might give
you a recommend.... But no. We’ll try without,
first. I fancy that honest face of yours will open the
pocket-books quicker than any note from me.”</p>

<p>And Ned sets out on his first begging expedition,
which proves so successful that in a few hours the
tumble-down stove retires ignominiously to make place
for a shining new one, in which the fire need not go out
while cold weather lasts; and the evening shadows,
creeping back to their favorite haunt, the attic, are
amazed and panic-stricken to find it occupied by a rosy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
troop of hilarious elfs, dancing up and down the wall,
with whom they must battle for possession.</p>

<p>Moreover, Ned has enlisted the sympathies of another
of his particular friends, Bridget, the cook, who fails
not to prepare, daily, delicacies for him to carry to the
sick boy—glad of an errand thither, for this new acquaintance
is extremely interesting, not in the least
like any one Ned has ever met before, so young and
yet so accomplished. Why, he can give a hundred
hints about playing on that precious violin, he can
show sheets of music of his own composing, a portfolio
full of sketches, his own work, in pencil and crayon
and oil; and, oh! to hear him talk of wonderful Paris,
and of famous people whom he has seen and whom
his father has known.</p>

<p>Perhaps a month has passed, when, upon an afternoon,
Ned, bounding in all aglow from the frosty air
without, stops short, seeing the pallid face is not lifted
in eager greeting from among the cushions.</p>

<p>“Is he asleep?” he whispers.</p>

<p>“Yes,” sobs Jeanette.</p>

<p class="tb">By and by as the lad turns slowly away, she places
in his hands the portfolio, saying;</p>

<p>“He tells me eet ees for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p class="tb">Belle, noticing her brother as he enters the house
and hurries through the hall on his way to his room,
exclaims:</p>

<p>“Why, Ned, you’ve been crying! What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>“Ernest is dead!”</p>

<p>“Who is Ernest?” inquires the father, lately returned,
glancing up from his newspaper.</p>

<p>When he has heard Ned’s story he asks to see the
sketches. While he is examining them, Belle comes
and looks over his shoulder. Suddenly she utters a
little scream.</p>

<p>“Why, Ned, you darling! look here!”</p>

<p>They have found, among the rest, a picture which
Ned has not seen before. It brings tears to his eyes
again, to Belle’s, too; the grim old lawyer’s lips twitch
for a moment, and he goes off and has the painting
framed in most costly style, and hangs it above the
mantel in his study. Perhaps it may serve as reminder
of a bit of a sentence, spoken centuries ago, which
fortune-favored people, snuggling about the ingleside
on boisterous winter nights, are very apt to forget:
“The poor ye have always with you.”</p>

<p>You may imagine the faithful Jeannette is not neglected.
The sunniest spot in the cemetery is where a
marble cross tells you that Ernest is sleeping below.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
And the picture, what is it? It is a glimpse, in brown
and amber tints, of a wretched attic chamber with
dilapidated ceiling, and scant, worn-out furniture, and
bare, uneven floor. And the only light there comes
from the face peeping in through a door which stands
ajar—a boyish face, round and merry, with ruddy
cheeks, and big, heartful eyes, and brown bits of curls
clustering about the broad forehead—a frank, open,
cheery, winsome face. Now, away from the light which
streams from this face and into the sombre shadows,
frightened demons are turning to flee. And one of the
demons whose gloomy features are partly visible, and
whose hand grasps a dagger, you may guess was meant
for Despair. This picture has a name. Ernest painted
it underneath, in large letters of scarlet and gold. This
is the name—<span class="smcap">Sunshine</span>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CZAR_AND_CARPENTER">CZAR AND CARPENTER.</h2>

</div>

<p>“Dear Rudolph, art thou not well?” asks his
mother, in that native language which she loves. “For
some time past thou hast been so very quiet, and—”
there she pauses, not wanting to remind him of how
fretful and ill-natured he has been of late.</p>

<p>“Feel well enough!” he answers gruffly, and then is
sorry, and wishes he had gone to rest ten minutes ago,
as he thought of doing.</p>

<p>A tiny cloud of displeasure flits across the sweet,
gentle face, and little Karl, leaning against his mother’s
chair, twines an arm about her neck, and smooths her
sunny hair, as if to make amends. As for Rudolph’s
father, stern words spring to his lips; but suspecting
what is the trouble, he withholds them, only glancing
up from his book with eyes so full of unutterable sadness
that the boy creeps guiltily out of the room, and
off to his chamber above.</p>

<p>This is the trouble with Rudolph—he is haunted;
haunted by a demon whose name is Discontent. It first
appeared to him one evening in a certain elegant mansion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
on a certain fashionable avenue, whither he had
been sent with a message; for his father was to do
some repairing there. In the spacious, high-ceiled,
oak-paneled library, where he waited to see the master
of the house, this little demon stole up to him and
whispered:</p>

<p>“Look at it—at all this splendor! these tall mirrors,
and huge chandeliers, and rich paintings, and carved
cases of books! You never saw the like, did you?”</p>

<p>It followed him through the great hall with its
marble floor and high, arched entrance, followed him
down the wide steps and out into the street, whispering
all the while, pointing back at the smooth front of
stone and the plate-glass windows; then, when they
reached Rudolph’s home, pointing scornfully at the
humble cottage, and the entrance that is neither high
nor arched. It followed him in, this demon, into the
single apartment that is hall and library and kitchen
combined. It sat down beside him in the corner.
“Bah!” it muttered in disdain, “this lounge can’t
compare with that sofa where you rested just now.
But wasn’t it soft, though!” It called his attention to
all the objects around, sneering at the curtains because
they are not of damask, at the floor because it is uncarpeted,
at the wall-paper because it is cheap. It
noticed Rudolph’s mother laying the table, and asked,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
“Do you imagine that ladies who live in fine houses
ever get supper themselves? Bah! don’t you believe
it!” It noticed Rudolph’s father leaning back in his
arm-chair with closed eyes, weary after the day’s labor,
and queried, “Do you suppose that gentleman you saw
to-night ever gets tired, ever works? No, of course he
doesn’t. <em>He</em> never wears work-clothes, shabby and worn
like that! He always goes dressed in broadcloth, and
his purse is always full, and he carries himself like a
prince, and asks no odds of anybody. And did you mind
how he looked down at you, as if you were nothing
but a worm?—because your father’s only a carpenter!
Wonder if he’ll treat <em>him</em> so? Bah! isn’t it wretched to
be poor and to have to work!” And when Rudolph
took his place at the table, it was—“Bah! do you
think gentlemen ever eat anything so common as this?”
and he pushed from him the simple food, untasted, and
went back to his corner; and there he sat the whole
evening, and there he has spent every evening since,
his face buried in his hands, the demon whispering in
his ear. For it has never left him; no, not for a moment.
It has followed him everywhere. In school, day
after day it kept up a continual buzzing, hindering him
from getting his lessons—he, the one who had always
known them so well. It would compare his own garments
with those of one and another better clad than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
he. “And there’s Jesse James—see, he carries a gold
watch!” “And isn’t it mean for ’em to call you a
‘Dutchman!’ just because your father and mother
came from Germany—though <em>you</em> never lived there in
your life—and because you’re poor and only a carpenter’s
son. Pity your father couldn’t have been a count,
or a baron, or something like that! How everybody
would have stared when he rode along in his glittering
carriage, and how everybody would have wanted to be
friends, and would have asked him to dinner, and all
that! And how polite everybody would have been to
<em>you</em>! You wouldn’t have been a ‘Dutchman’ then;
oh, not at all! And if he had been a grand-duke, oh,
think of it! How everybody would have gone down to
the depot to meet him, and how people would have
crowded around to shake hands with him, and what a
fuss they would have made over him—as they did one
winter when Alexis was here, you know, and you
climbed up a lamp-post to get a glimpse of him.
Wasn’t he splendid, though! How grand it must be
to be the son of a Czar!”</p>

<p>But during the Christmas holidays, now almost over,
there has been no school, and Rudolph has had nothing
to do but the marketing, and keeping the walk before
the house clear of snow, and running here and
there about the city on errands for his father—who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
never has any vacation, the year round. And all these
days, oh, how that demon has tantalized him! It would
lead him through the market to where lay great heaps
of turkeys and geese and ducks, so plump and tempting,
ready for the oven. “But <em>you</em> can’t buy any, they
cost too much!” It would draw him close up to the
bakery windows. “Wouldn’t Karl like one of those delicious
cakes, though! But you can’t buy it, it costs too
much. Isn’t it too bad to have to count the pennies
so?” All the way down the street, of pleasant afternoons,
it would keep tormenting, pointing now at the
richly-dressed ladies out shopping: “Pity your mother
can’t have velvets, and feathers, and furs, like that, and
be fashionable!” now exclaiming: “Look! there goes
Jesse James. He’s taking his sister out for a sleigh-ride.
Aren’t those horses just splendid! and that robe,
look at it! it’s a real tiger’s skin! and the bells, oh, how
they jingle! By the way, did you hear him telling one
of the schoolboys, last week, about the Christmas present
he was going to give his cousin Florence?—a set of
diamonds! think of it! Here are some, right here in
this shop-window. Look at them! see how they shine!...
Pity <em>you</em> can’t make somebody a Christmas
present!—your cousin Mina, for instance. Pity <em>you</em>
can’t take somebody out sleigh-riding. Never had a
sleigh-ride yourself, for that matter. Never had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
ride any way, except in a street-car. Never had a single
chance to drive a horse, even.... What’s the
reason some can have everything they want, and others—oh!
don’t it make you mad the way things go on in
this world?”</p>

<p>Yes, it does make him “mad.” He goes about glum
and scowling. (He used to be pleasant enough.) The
ripple of his laughter is no longer heard, and he frolics
no more with little Karl, who hardly dares approach
him, he is so cross. And thus it is that his mother is
led to question if he is not well, and thus it is that his
father comes to suspect what is the trouble, and to
guess the name of the demon that has crept in to disturb
their peaceful home, and to vex the bright, ambitious
boy he is so proud of. The book he is reading
has lost its interest, for hours he scarcely turns a page;
and it is a great relief to lay it aside when the consoling
little Karl, feeling that something is amiss, climbs
sleepily into his arms and lays a velvety cheek against
his own.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there is that wicked demon up-stairs
upon the pillow, never ceasing its poisonous whispering,
till Rudolph, unable to shake off the tormentor, at
last gives way to sobs and tears, thankful that he is
alone and in the dark, for he wouldn’t have so much as
a ray of daylight catch him crying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Oh, Rudolph, is there no one to come to you here and
drive away that demon, by telling you of all the mighty
ones who have risen from humbler stations than yours—aye,
climbed, round by round, up the ladder of fortune
till they reached the top, admired and applauded by the
crowds below—will no one comfort you by telling you
of these?</p>

<p>Wait; here comes some one into the room, comes
close to the bedside—a stranger. Perhaps he has come
for that.... But no; listen to what he says:</p>

<p>“Arise, Rudolph, and accompany me to the palace of
the Czar.”</p>

<p>The lad stares in amazement at the speaker—a tall,
gaunt personage, wrapped in a black mantle that almost
touches the floor, and so conceals the head and face
with its ample folds that only the eyes are visible.
What black, piercing eyes!—blacker than the mantle.
Rudolph stares, and then arises, obedient.</p>

<p>The two travelers are not long in reaching their destination,
and Rudolph soon finds himself in the imperial
palace, in a great saloon, magnificent beyond comparison
with that oak-paneled library he saw some time
ago. There is dancing here, and the glittering dresses
of the dancers dazzle him, and the music is so delightful
it drives him nearly wild. When finally he lifts his
dizzy eyes from the whirling throng, he sees, sitting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
in state at the farther end of the apartment, one who he
concludes is the Czar; for all who approach him bow
low and speak to him reverently.</p>

<p>“Would Rudolph like to be Czar?” asks the personage
in black.</p>

<p>“A-a-ah!” exclaims the other, smiling and clasping
his hands.</p>

<p>“Then bide your time.”</p>

<p>They wait behind a heavy curtain till the music
ceases, and the dancers are gone, and the lights are extinguished,
and the long saloon is dark and empty.
Then the muffled stranger leads through a maze of galleries
and corridors, unlocks, at length, a door, bids
Rudolph enter, and Rudolph obeys. This apartment,
also, is magnificent, but not so large as the other. At
one side is a downy couch with golden-fringed drapery,
and there the great Czar reposes. Upon the wall, near,
hangs a sword.</p>

<p>“Take it down,” commands the personage in black;
and Rudolph takes it down.</p>

<p>“Raise it,” is the second command, as they stand
over the sleeping Czar; and Rudolph raises on high
the gleaming sword.</p>

<p>“Strike!” And Rudolph strikes.</p>

<p>“Now return it to its place and follow me.” And
Rudolph returns the weapon, dripping, to its place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
upon the wall, and follows back through the long galleries
and corridors, and down the marble stairs, and
out and away from the palace, and out and away from
the city—away to a cave in the mountains. And the
personage in black again commands, “Stay here and
bide your time.”</p>

<p>Day after day there come to them, in their hiding-place,
rumors, now of the murder of the Czar, now of
strife and difference among his subjects over who shall
be successor, and, finally, of an invasion by the neighboring
monarchs, who, seeing the people at war among
themselves, would profit by this opportunity to gain
possession of the Empire.</p>

<p>“Now is your time!” says the personage in black
to Rudolph, and he leads him into the midst of the
battles, and teaches him so well the art of warfare, that
from the ranks he soon rises to be Field-Marshal.
Then, the personage in black always secretly counseling,
Rudolph (always blindly obedient, he knows not
why), following closely his instructions, defeats the invading
armies in every battle, drives them out of the
Empire, pursues them into their own provinces, and
returns triumphant; and the people greet him with
loud rejoicing, and lead him to the great throne-room,
and robe him in the ermine-lined robe, and crown him
with the jeweled crown, and shout till the echoes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
ring—“Hail, Rudolph, the Czar!” and, “Long live Rudolph,
the Czar!”</p>

<p>And again there are music and dancing; and it is
Rudolph, now, who is seated in state above the glittering
throng, and all who approach him bow low and
address him reverently—excepting one—a tall, gaunt
personage, with muffled face, and piercing eyes, and
long, black mantle, who steals up behind him and
whispers, “Does Rudolph enjoy being Czar?” And
Rudolph, remembering all, neither clasps his hands
nor smiles.</p>

<p>At midnight, as Rudolph lies upon the downy couch
with its silken folds and golden-fringed drapery, suddenly
waking from slumber, he sees one standing over
him with lifted sword; and he springs upon the
assassin, and seizes his sword, and calls to the attendants,
and has him put in irons; and this man makes
confession, and reveals to the Czar a plot among the
nobles against his life; then Rudolph causes some of
those conspirators to be thrown into prison, and some
to be beheaded; and, for further safety, the guard in
the palace is increased. But not long after, again suddenly
waking in the middle of the night, he sees
another standing over him with lifted sword; and he
springs upon this one also, and seizes his sword, and
calls to the attendants, and has him bound with irons;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and behold, when the lights are brought, this man is
found to be one of the palace guard; and he, too,
makes confession, and reveals to the Czar that all in
the army are his foes and ready to take his life; then
Rudolph sends out and causes some of the Generals
and chief conspirators of the army to be imprisoned,
and others to be beheaded; and, for further safety, he
places his most faithful and trusty servant to watch in
his chamber while he sleeps. But a third time, suddenly
waking at midnight, he sees this servant standing
over him with lifted sword; and him, too, he overpowers,
and seizes the murderous weapon; and this
man, also, confesses; and from him the Czar learns
that all in the palace hate him and have plotted to take
his life.</p>

<p>So it comes to pass that Rudolph, the Czar, dares not
close his eyes day or night, for there is no one whom
he can trust to protect him while he slumbers. And
as the weeks and months wear away, he grows so haggard
with watching, so weary for lack of sleep, that
one morning, ere the sun has risen, and while all is
hushed and silent, he casts aside the robe of ermine,
and the golden crown and sceptre, and steals away
from the palace, and out through the palace garden, and
off to the fields beyond; and there, feeling secure, he
lies down and closes his eyes, and is just falling into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
delicious slumber, when the sound of stealthy footsteps
arouses him, and looking up, behold one standing over
him with lifted sword; and he springs up to defend
himself, but the other turns and flees. Then he goes
on till he reaches a wide forest, and thinking, “Surely
no one will molest me here,” he lies down with a sigh
of relief, and is just losing himself in sleep, when the
howling of wolves disturbs him, and he is obliged to
hurry onward, to escape being torn in pieces by those
ferocious beasts.</p>

<p>When he reaches the plain at the other side of the
forest, he perceives, at some distance, a group of huts,
and saying, “Surely no one will know me there,” he
approaches them and asks for lodging, and is shown to
a rude chamber, where, just as he is about to lie down,
he spies some object crouching among the shadows,
and moving toward it, behold, a peasant armed with a
glittering sword. And the wretched Czar departs in
haste, saying, “My enemies are my own subjects;”
and he pauses not till he is far beyond the boundaries
of his own realm. Now at last in a country ruled by
another, thinking, “I am surely safe,” he throws himself
down by the wayside, faint and footsore; but just
as sweet sleep is stealing over him, listen—a rustling,
and look—a highwayman standing near with lifted
sword; and he wearily moans, and, rising, hastens away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>At length he comes to a great city, and saying,
“Surely none will know me or wish to harm me here,”
he finds lodgings for the night, and lays himself down to
rest, when lo! one approaches softly with lifted sword,
and Rudolph, the Czar, recognizes the face of him he
saw in the field beyond the palace garden. “Alas, he
has followed me hither!” he cries, and hurriedly leaves
the city.</p>

<p>And so, wherever he goes, he dares not sleep, either
from fear of assassins, or of highwaymen, or of wild
beasts. And so he wanders, and ever wanders on.
And one day as he drags himself along, seeking a place
to rest, he stops to drink from a fountain beside the
path, and as he kneels over the smooth, mirror-like
waters, he discovers that his locks are very white, and
that his garments are thread-bare and torn. Still onward
and onward he journeys, sleep the one thing that
he longs for.</p>

<p>At last, as he emerges from the shadows of a dark
defile between high mountains, he lifts his heavy,
drooping eyelids, and beholds, spread out beyond, a
valley far lovelier than any he has seen in all his
journeyings. Slowly and gently it climbs up and into
the purpling distance, with other valleys stepping
down between the hills to meet it, and little hamlets
nestling at the feet of those hills. And he says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
“Surely in so peaceful a valley nothing can disturb
me. I will get me to one of those villages and inquire
for an inn, and there I will rest—there I will sleep,
sleep, sleep.”</p>

<p>But just where the defile opens into the valley he
encounters an armed sentinel, who steps forward and
asks for his pass.</p>

<p>“I have no pass,” he answers.</p>

<p>“Then thou canst not enter.”</p>

<p>“But I am no common man. I am great, and famous,
and much feared.”</p>

<p>“That matters not. Thou hast no pass. I may not
let thee enter.”</p>

<p>“But hark you! I am Czar of all the Russias.”</p>

<p>“Whatever or whoever thou art, thou hast no pass;
therefore our King knows thee not; I may not let thee
enter. Answer me no more.”</p>

<p>And Rudolph, the Czar, complaining bitterly, crawls
a little way off and casts himself down among the
rocks. While he lies there, peering wistfully into the
beautiful valley, wondering at the blueness of the heavens
and the softness of the light, listening to the gurgling
of waters, and catching glimpses of cataracts
flashing down the distant hills, under overhanging
branches—while he lies there, one, haughty, and bearing
himself like a prince, draws near, and Rudolph remembers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
to have met him in a spacious, oak-paneled
library, long ago, when he, the Czar, was a boy.</p>

<p>No sooner does this one reach the entrance to the
valley, than the sentinel appears as before, and demands
his pass. The other hands him a paper, which
he examines, and pronounces to be worthless. “It
bears not our King’s signature, but that of his worst
enemy. Begone, impostor!”</p>

<p>“But I am a millionaire! I own ships upon the sea,
laden with merchandise, and mines in the earth rich
with ore, and acres of land more than I can count!”</p>

<p>“Away! Answer me no more.”</p>

<p>And the rich man turns away in wrath and confusion.</p>

<p>Presently appears another, in workman’s garb, which
proves to be only a disguise, for, as he nears the entrance
to the valley, on a sudden behold him a warrior
clad in armor! And this armor is like nothing that
Rudolph, the Czar, has seen. The various pieces of
which it is composed are of different hues; the helmet
white as snow, and so dazzling that he turns his eyes
from it as he would turn them from the burning sun of
noonday; the breastplate like gold, only brighter; the
sword red like flame; the shield is as if it were of adamant,
and the device upon it is an anchor. As the
warrior gives his pass to the sentinel, the Czar, unseen,
recognizes his own father!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>But the sentinel does not look at the pass. “I know
thee by thine armor!” he cries, with a smile of welcome,
and immediately blows a bugle which he carries,
and the sound rings through the valley—sweetly,
sweetly! winding among the hills, sending back a
thousand echoes on its way. Then the people pour
out of the hamlets, and come down in myriads to meet
the warrior, strewing the way with flowers and greeting
him with music—oh, so marvelous! oh, so thrilling!
that the very light moves to and fro in little waves, as
if keeping time, and the flashing, gurgling waters join
the chorus, and the overhanging branches swing a slow
accompaniment.</p>

<p>Among the people who surround the warrior, just
one glimpse has Rudolph, the Czar, of her who was
once his mother, arrayed in garments the beauty of
which is only surpassed by the beauty of her face, and
her face surpasses in loveliness all that he ever imagined
could be; just one glimpse, too, of another face
he has known; then the people close about them and
they are lost sight of; and while he reaches out his
hands, crying, “Oh, my mother! Oh, my brother!
Oh, my father!” the radiant throng moves backward
up the valley and into one of those other valleys, and
disappears, and the music grows fainter and fainter.
As he lies weeping and listening to that faint, far melody,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
one from the valley, mantled in white and mounted
upon a snowy steed, rides into the dark defile, and as
he passes by where Rudolph, the Czar, lies, the latter
questions:</p>

<p>“Where have they taken the warrior who entered
just now?”</p>

<p>“They are leading him to the royal city, to receive
from our King’s own hands the unfading crown of
laurels which is given to the victors.”</p>

<p>“But I was once well acquainted with this one, and
I never knew that he was a warrior, nor did I guess
that he wore armor.”</p>

<p>“There are many who wear armor unsuspected, and
fight their battles unseen.”</p>

<p>“But how did he procure his pass?”</p>

<p>“Hast thou not heard how our King sends forth
spies into all lands to search for those who will make
good, loyal subjects, ever willing to obey and carry out
his commands? To all such are given passes, signed
by the King himself, that when they come hither they
may be allowed to enter. All others are excluded, lest,
entering, they annoy the peaceful citizens, and stir up
strife and discord.”</p>

<p>“But this warrior’s armor was unlike anything I
have ever seen. Of what metal is it composed?”</p>

<p>“It is made of several different metals; the helmet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
of a mixture of two metals, called Truth and Honesty;
the breastplate is also of two metals, Patience
and Constancy; the sword, of the Hatred of all that is
base and evil; and the shield, of the Hope of admission
to our land; for this—to gain entrance here—is
considered the highest privilege that can be granted to
any mortal. But I ride on an errand for the King, and
must not delay.”</p>

<p>“One moment more, O bright one! Is there no
secret path by which I can gain entrance to this peaceful
kingdom? Is this the only way?”</p>

<p>“This is the only way.”</p>

<p>“O bright one, return, I pray thee, to the King, and
entreat him in my behalf that he will permit me to
enter! for I am weary, oh! I am <em>so</em> weary, and I can
find no place where I may rest; and there, too, are all
who love or care for me, and all I love or care for.”</p>

<p>But the messenger answers sorrowfully, “Thou hast
no pass!” and rides away, and the snow-white mantle
and the snow-white steed flit along through the brooding
shadows till, in the distance, they are lost from
view. And Rudolph, the Czar, straining his eyes to
follow them, is suddenly startled by a loud, mocking
laugh that rings weirdly up and down the dark defile;
and, turning, he sees standing behind him the tall,
gaunt personage in black; and the sight of that muffled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
figure so fills him with terror, that he rises and hastens
away as fast as his feeble limbs can carry him.</p>

<p>And now there comes to him remembrance of a place
where, when he was a boy, he rested well and slept
undisturbed; and onward he journeys by land and sea,
pausing not till he reaches his native town and has
found the humble cottage where he used to dwell. He
creeps softly to the window and peers in. It is all
there, just as it used to be—the cupboard in this corner;
the chintz-covered lounge in that; the simple
brown paper on the wall; the window-curtains of muslin;
the clock on the mantel; the clean, white floor;
the polished stove; the vapor curling from the spout
of the shining tea-kettle—all there, so comfortable, so
cosy, so homelike! But the people are strangers.
That is not little Karl playing on the floor; that is not
the mother knitting in the rocking-chair. And Rudolph,
the Czar, weeps again, remembering how the last
words he had for them were harsh words, and that he
is never to see them more.</p>

<p>At length he knocks at the door and explains to the
master of the house—</p>

<p>“I am a feeble old man, in agony of weariness for
lack of sleep; for I have traveled far and searched
long, but have found no place where I might rest in
peace. And I finally bethought me of a low room under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
a sloping roof, where, in my childhood, I rested
well and undisturbed. The roof above is that same
sloping roof, and beneath it is that chamber. And I
will give to thee, good sir, all the gold in my purse—and
there is much gold in it—if I may lodge there for
one night only, and sleep once more as I slept when I
was a lad.”</p>

<p>And the good man of the house bids him enter and
welcome, but refuses the proffered gold. And Rudolph,
the Czar, climbs up the narrow stairs to the low
room under the sloping roof, and he lies down there,
forgetting to look for the lifted sword, and he closes
his weary eyes, and a delicious drowsiness steals over
him, and there is no fear in his heart, and nothing molests
him, and at last he sleeps, sleeps, sleeps.</p>

<p class="tb">What sound is that? A ringing of bells. It wakens
Rudolph. He gazes about the room. On a stand in
the corner a lamp is dimly burning. Some one is sitting
here beside the bed. “Oh, go away, good sir, and
leave me in peace!” he moans piteously. “Did I not
offer thee all the gold in my purse? Why, then, dost
thou trouble me? Do no murder, I beseech thee, for
I am old and feeble, and I have not slept before in a
hundred years.”</p>

<p>“Thou art dreaming, Rudolph. There is nothing to
fear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“Thou, my father!” and he seizes the two toil-hardened
hands, covering them with kisses and with tears.
“How camest thou here? I feared I should never behold
thy face again! And where are my mother and
my brother?”</p>

<p>“The dear mother and our little Karl will see thee
in the morning to wish thee a ‘Happy New Year.’”</p>

<p>A Happy New Year! Rudolph puts his hand to his
forehead, as if to smooth out some knot there underneath.
“Truly, I do not know,” he murmurs, “it all
seemed so real. Have I been dreaming, dear father?”</p>

<p>And then the father explains how he heard wailing
and shrieking in the night, and came to learn the
cause, but, fearing a fever, staid to watch awhile.</p>

<p>“It is hard, dear father, that after thou hast been
working all the day thou must needs watch all the
night.”</p>

<p>“I would do much more than that for Rudolph, although
he is ‘only the son of a carpenter.’”</p>

<p>“Alas, that I talked in my sleep!”</p>

<p>Hark, the bells! once more they clang together—all
the bells in the town. So it is, so it is the New
Year! They are ringing in the New Year. And these
New-Year days—standing like mile-stones all along the
highway of Time—who gave them to the world for
holidays? Was it not “the carpenter’s son”? Rudolph,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
trying to smooth out the kink in his brain,
finds that thought entangled with it, somehow. After
awhile he exclaims, with face aglow:</p>

<p>“It is good that this is the first day of the year!
That is the grand time to turn over a new leaf—no, to
put on a new suit of armor! For I have learned something
from my dream, father; it is this—thou art a
Hero. And I mean to be another, just like thee!”</p>

<p>And the father looks down into Rudolph’s eyes, and
sees that the demon has departed.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">“He will miss his little Mabel,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">To toast the bread for his supper</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And make him a cup of tea.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So she dwelt in the marble palace,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">The people with cheers would greet,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">With story, and dance, and song.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But often herself she questioned,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">How is it with them at home?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As the palace with mirth and music</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Echoed and rang, one night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The people peered through the windows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Watching the festive sight:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a beggar in rags and tatters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Listening, shook his fist;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“What right have they to be merry</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">When my little ones starve?” he hissed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the people his words repeated:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“What right, to be sure?” they said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Flaunting in silks and diamonds</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">While our little ones cry for bread.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And ever, as thus they murmured,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Louder their voices grew,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till, all in a red-hot anger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To the palace doors they flew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sentinels, at each entrance,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Quickly they put to flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And hurried with cries and clamor</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Into the halls so bright—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the halls of marble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With clubs and with axes armed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the sound of their shouts and curses</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The courtiers hearing, alarmed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fled in their silks and diamonds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Leaving the queen alone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On rushed the riotous rabble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Making its way to the throne,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Brandished, intent to kill.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then she shrieked for help in her terror,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Never a friend came nigh.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, as the crowd drew nearer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sudden she turned to fly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And casting aside the purple robe</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the heavy golden crown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away and away she hastened,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Down to the meadows wandered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Hastened away and away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till the birds and the dewy blossoms</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the world it was sad and silent,</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Wearily and forlorn.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The burnie it went complaining,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Making no pleasant music,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Singing no pleasant song;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ever as in the hedges</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She came to a sweet wild rose,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At the touch of her queenly fingers</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The petals would sadly close.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Once did she call, “Sing, birdies!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But the little birds were dumb:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come to me as you used to!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">But they, fearing, would not come.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“What a cosy place to live in!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She paused at a cottage door.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Not a palace half so lovely</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is there the country o’er!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within sat a woman knitting—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A woman aged and blind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ever she dropped the stitches,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Trying in vain to find.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Grandmother, let me help thee,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Mabel held out her hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nay,” said the gray-haired woman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">“Thou art the queen of the land!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Just at that moment entered</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">A workingman—quick she cried</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Father, oh, dost thou know me?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sorrowfully he sighed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh, queen and gracious lady,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tell me if thou dost know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aught of our little Mabel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Who was lost long years ago?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On a sunny summer morning</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">She strayed from the meadows green.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me if thou hast seen her—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tell me, oh, gracious queen!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Alas, they, too, have forgotten!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bowing her head, she wept—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the weeping queen awakened,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And found she had only slept.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Safe in her low-ceiled chamber,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Flooded with rosy light,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Only the little Mabel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The Mabel of yesternight!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then aloud rejoicing sang she</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The song of the day gone by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Glad, glad is the morning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And happy and gay am I!”</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">It chanced, a picture found—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A painting blurred and faded:</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Two men had fought, and one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay vanquished, while the other,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With foot his neck upon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A murd’rous weapon brandished</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Above the prostrate head.</div>

  <div class="stanza">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Came never word of answer.</div>
